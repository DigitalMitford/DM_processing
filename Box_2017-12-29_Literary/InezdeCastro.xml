				<note>This edition compares the final published text of 1854 against the manuscript version of the play held in the British Library, originally submitted in 1831 to the Examiner's office and the Dicks' Standard Plays edition published in the 1880s.</note>
				<note>The hand-writing in the manuscript verion of the play appears to be that of a copyist rather than Mary Russell Mitford. The manuscript, which was submitted to the Lord Chamberlain's Office for review, is dated 28 February 1831 and is titled <title>Inez de Castro, a Tragedy in Five Acts</title>.</note>

				<handNote>The manuscript of 1831 does not appear to be written in Mitford's hand, but rather in the hand of a copyist. A second hand in pencil has renumbered the pages for inclusion in this volume of Plays from the Lord Chamberlain's Office, folio pages 188-239.</handNote>

				<p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

						<head>SCENE I.</head>

							<l>A Splendid Hall of Audience in the King's Palace at Lisbon; a Throne in the Centre of the Stage.</l>


							<l>Antonio, Garcia , and Alvarez, meeting in Front; Courtiers and Attendants entering and passing in the Background.</l>


						<sp who="#Alvarez_IC">
							<speaker>Alv.</speaker>
							<l>Good morrow, Don Antonio. Noble Garcia,</l>
							<l>A fair good morrow. Ye are early.</l>
						</sp>

						<sp who="#Garcia_IC">
							<speaker>Gar.</speaker>
							<l>Sir,</l>
							<l>We wait the King's commands.</l>
						</sp>

						<sp who="#Antonio_IC">
							<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
							<l>'Tis like to prove</l>
							<l>A stirring day.</l>
						</sp>

						<sp who="#Alvarez_IC">
							<speaker>Alv.</speaker>
							<l>A day of stirring mirth,</l>
							<l>I grant ye. First to ride with the fair Princess</l>
							<l>And her fair train to Setuval's green wood,</l>
							<l>To chase the spotted deer; then speeding back,</l>
							<l>Haste to the royal banquet at the palace.</l>


			<pb edRef="#IC1854" n="52"/>


							<l>Why, good Antonio, so to spend the hours,</l>
							<l>Seems to a soldier pleasant idleness;</l>
							<l>However, a grave councillor may shrink</l>
							<l>From the loud din of revelry.</l>
						</sp>

						<sp who="#Antonio_IC">
							<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
							<l>Thou'lt hear</l>
							<l>Afore the mirth begins, a louder din,</l>
							<l>And of a ruder nature. Know'st thou not,</l>
							<l>Alvarez, that last night Count d'Aguilar</l>
							<l>Arrived at Lisbon with an urgent message</l>
							<l>From Philip of Castille?</l>
						</sp>

						<sp who="#Alvarez_IC">
							<speaker>Alv.</speaker>
							<l>To press the nuptials</l>
							<l>Betwixt Don Pedro and his sister?</l>
						</sp>

						<sp who="#Antonio_IC">
							<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
							<l>That</l>
							<l>Ye'll know anon. The King receives him here.</l>
						</sp>

						<sp who="#Alvarez_IC">
							<speaker>Alv.</speaker>
							<l>The ambassador will scarce find fitting welcome</l>
							<l>From our wild Prince. He better loves to chase</l>
							<l>Swift stag, or white-tusked boar, or to pursue</l>
							<l>The noble sport of war, and drive the bold</l>
							<l>And tawny Moor before his conquering hosts,</l>
							<l>Than to lie basking in a lady's smiles</l>
							<l>In our soft orange-groves.</l>
						</sp>

						<sp who="#Antonio_IC">
							<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
							<l>I know not that.</l>
							<l>Certain he loves not Constance.</l>
						</sp>

						<sp who="#Alvarez_IC">
							<speaker>Alv.</speaker>
							<l>Yet is she</l>
							<l>A stately beauty.</l>
						</sp>

						<sp who="#Garcia_IC">
							<speaker>Gar.</speaker>
							<l>Her young handmaid Inez</l>
							<l>Is fairer.</l>
						</sp>

						<sp who="#Antonio_IC">
							<speaker>Ant.</speaker>
							<l>So Don Manuel thinks. These girls</l>
							<l>Of Spain have made strange havoc 'midst the wits</l>
							<l>Of our staid Court. I speak not of such gallants</l>
							<l>As ye, whose hearts be light as shuttlecocks</l>
							<l>From beauty tossed to beauty; but Don Manuel,</l>
							<l>The wise and powerful minister, that he</l>
							<l>Should sigh for a young maid, and sigh in vain,</l>


			<pb edRef="#IC1854" n="53"/>


							<l>May wake some triumph 'midst these Spanish dames.</l>

							<l>Now, good my lord,</l>

							<l>Sire, is the Prince</l>
							<l>Don Pedro here? Mine errand touches him</l>
							<l>As nearly as thyself; since on his union</l>
							<l>With our fair Lady Constance hangs the weal</l>

						<sp who="#Pedro_IC">
							<speaker>Ped. (Advancing.)</speaker>
							<l>Ay, to his sorrow. Say whate'er thou wilt,</l>
							<l>But what thou wilt, say quickly. Kingdoms, bridals,</l>
							<l>Grave state-craft, and light love! Why, we are bound</l>
							<l>To the forest, man! the dew lies on the grass;</l>
							<l>The air is fresh and moist; our hounds to-day</l>
							<l>Will track their quarry well. Come, and I'll show thee</l>
							<l>Our woodsman's mysteries. Keep thy dull lessons</l>
							<l>For duller seasons, sober afternoons,</l>
							<l>Or days of State processions of Court banquets;</l>
							<l>This is a morn made for the merry chase---</l>

						</sp>

						<sp who="#DAguilar_IC">
							<speaker>D'Ag.</speaker>
							<l>Have I not already</l>
							<l>Disclosed its purport? Good my liege, my message</l>
							<l>Needs no interpreter. There's not a man</l>
							<l>In this fair presence or this populous land,</l>
							<l>But, ere a word be spoken, reads right well</l>
							<l>Mine errand; knows that I stand here to claim</l>
							<l>Instant fulfilment of the solemn league</l>
							<l>Betwixt Castille and Portugal; the treaty,</l>
							<l>Planned by wise statists, drawn by learned lawmen,</l>
							<l>Signed by two mighty sovereigns, hailed and blest</l>
							<l>By the universal people, whose chief clause</l>
							<l>Binds Don Alphonso's warlike son to wed</l>
							<l>Don Philip's beauteous sister. The fair Princess,</l>
							<l>Reposing on the sacred faith of nations,</l>
							<l>And that great bond of honour, a King's word,</l>
							<l>Came at your bidding, full of loyal trust,</l>
							<l>To meet and to espouse her plighted lord;</l>

							<l>I was in Africk, as the Moors,</l>

							<l>Ask the white bones that strew the sands of Fez,</l>
							<l>The nimble slaves that shrouded them in Oran,</l>

							<l>The undefended King, that thou might'st climb</l>
							<l>The vacant throne, and seat thee there, usurping</l>
							<l>The crown thou shouldst inherit. Sir, my son</l>
							<l>Was a frank, loyal knight, who would have spurned</l>
							<l>Treason and traitor. Wherefore pause? Come on,</l>
							<l>And drink thy monarch's blood. Dost fear to meet</l>
							<l>My single arm? There lies my sword. My breast</l>
							<l>Is open to thy weapon. Strike, I say!</l>
