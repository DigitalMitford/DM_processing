                <head><title ref="#Great_Farmhouse_OV">A GREAT FARM-HOUSE</title>.</head>
                <p>These are bad times for farmers. I am sorry for it. Independently of all questions of policy, as a mere matter of taste and of old association, it was a fine thing to witness the hearty hospitality, and to think of the social happiness of a great farm-house. No situation in life seemed so richly privileged; none had so much power for good and so little for evil; it seemed a place where pride could not live, and poverty could not enter. These thoughts pressed on my mind the other day, in passing the green sheltered lane, overhung with trees like an avenue, that leads to <placeName>the great farm at <placeName ref="#M_Great_Farmhouse_OV">M.</placeName></placeName>,<note resp="#scw">In a letter to <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William Elford</persName> of <date when="1816">1816</date>, Mitford mentions the death of her friend <persName ref="#Newell_Mr">Mr. Newell</persName> of <placeName ref="#Whitby_Park">Whitby Park</placeName>. While L'Estrange dates this letter as <date when="1816-11-24">November 24, 1816</date>, it was in fact written on <date when="1816-10-20">October 20, 1816</date>. Several things argue for Mr. Newell as the original of the farmer in this sketch, notably verbatim passages that are repeated in this sketch from the Elford letter, as well as strong echoes. In addition, the election backdrop that Mitford stages in A Great Farmhouse is reminiscent of the 1816 Parliamentary elections. She mentions Mr. Newell in unpublished letters to <persName ref="#Webb_Mary_younger">Mary Webb</persName> of <date when="1816-10-28">October 28, 1816</date>, in which she tells of receiving one of his greyhounds upon his death, and to Elford of <date when="1816-12-23">December 23, 1816</date>, in which she shares an epitaph she wrote for him.<!--scw update, 6/18/17: Our ms files contain this letter to Elford and Mary Webb. See photos 988 and 989 for Elford.--></note> where ten or twelve years ago,<note resp="#scw">Mitford composed this sketch in <date when="1822-04">April 1822</date>, which places these general recollections around the years <date when="1810">1810</date> to <date when="1812">1812</date>.</note> I used to spend so many pleasant days. I could not help advancing a few paces up the lane, and then turning to lean over the gate, seemingly gazing on the rich undulating valley, crowned with woody hills, which, as I stood under the dark and shady arch, lay bathed in the sunshine before me, but really absorbed in thoughts of other times, in recollections of the old delights of that<pb n="49"/> delightful place, and of the admirable qualities of its owners. How often I had opened that gate, and how gaily—certain of meeting a smiling welcome—and what a picture of comfort it was!</p>
                <p>Passing up the lane, we used first to encounter a thick solid suburb of ricks, of all sorts, shapes, and dimensions. Then came the farm, like a town; a magnificent series of buildings, stables, cart-houses, cow-houses, granaries, and barns, that might hold half the corn of the parish, placed at all angles towards each other, and mixed with smaller habitations for <rs type="animal" ref="#pig">pigs</rs>, <rs type="animal" ref="#dog">dogs</rs>, and <rs type="animal" ref="#poultry">poultry</rs>. They formed, together with the old substantial farm-house, a sort of amphitheatre, looking over a beautiful meadow, which swept greenly and abruptly down into fertile inclosures, richly set with hedge-row <rs type="tree" ref="#timber">timber</rs>, <rs type="tree" ref="#oak">oak</rs>, and <rs type="tree" ref="#ash">ash</rs>, and <rs type="tree" ref="#elm">elm</rs>. Both the meadow and the farm-yard swarmed with inhabitants of the earth and of the air; <rs type="animal" ref="#horse">horses</rs>, <rs type="animal" ref="#oxen">oxen</rs>, <rs type="animal" ref="#cow">cows</rs>, <rs type="animal" ref="#calve">calves</rs>, <rs type="animal" ref="#heifer">heifers</rs>, <rs type="animal" ref="#sheep">sheep</rs>, and <rs type="animal" ref="#pig">pigs</rs>; beautiful <rs type="animal" ref="#greyhound">greyhounds</rs>, all manner of <rs type="animal" ref="#poultry">poultry</rs>, a tame <rs type="animal" ref="#goat">goat</rs>, and a pet <rs type="animal" ref="#donkey">donkey</rs>.</p>
                <p>The <rs type="person" ref="#Great_Farmhouse_farmer_OV">master of this land of plenty</rs> was well fitted to preside over it; a thick, stout man, of middle height, and middle age, with a healthy, ruddy, square face, all alive with intelligence and good-humour. There was a lurking jest in his eye, and a smile about the corners of his firmly-closed lips, that gave assurance of good fellowship. His voice was loud enough to<pb n="50"/> have hailed a ship at sea, without the assistance of a speaking-trumpet,<note resp="#scw">The foregoing sentence is found verbatim in Mitford's <date when="1816-10-20">October 20, 1816</date> letter to <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William Elford</persName>, in which she tells him of <persName ref="#Newell_Mr">Mr. Newell</persName>'s death.</note> wonderfully rich and round in its tones, and harmonizing admirably with his bluff, jovial visage. He wore his dark shining hair combed straight over his forehead, and had a trick, when particularly merry, of stroking it down with his hand. The moment his right hand approached his head, out-flew a jest.</p>
                <p>Besides his own great farm, the business of which seemed to go on like machinery, always regular, prosperous, and unfailing,—besides this and two or three constant stewardships, and a perpetual succession of arbitrations, in which, such was the influence of his acuteness, his temper, and his sturdy justice, that he was often named by both parties, and left to decide alone,—in addition to these occupations, he was a sort of standing overseer and church-warden;<!--scw: I think these occupations, such as they, might be explained in a note. How would a farmer be called upon to be a steward, etc? I will look into this--> he ruled his own hamlet like a despotic monarch, and took a prime minister’s share in the government of the large parish to which it was attached; and one of the <rs type="person" ref="#Great_Farmhouse_MP_OV">gentlemen</rs>, whose estates he managed, being the <rs type="person" ref="#Great_Farmhouse_MP_OV">independent member<rs type="place" ref="#Reading_city">independent borough</rs><!--scw: Is there a way to tag electoral boroughs? as opposed to cities? Should this be tagged, since she is not being definite?--></rs>, he had every now and then a contested election on his shoulders.<!--scw: need a note defining contested elections here; I did some research, and suspect the MP could refer to Shaw-Lefevre, who did seem to have independent leanings at the time Mr Newell died--> Even that did not discompose him. He had always leisure to receive his friends at home, or to visit them abroad; to take journeys to <placeName ref="#London_city">London</placeName>, or make excursions to the sea-side; was as punctual in pleasure as in<pb n="51"/> business, and thought being happy and making happy as much the purpose of his life as getting rich. His great amusement was coursing. He kept several brace of capital <rs type="animal" ref="#greyhound">greyhounds</rs>, so high-blooded, that I remember when five of them were confined in five different kennels on account of their ferocity. The greatest of living painters once called a <rs type="animal" ref="#greyhound">greyhound</rs>, <quote>“the line of beauty in perpetual motion.”</quote><!--SCW: Quote as yet unidentified, but I wonder if she means Haydon? He is said to have frequently coursed greyhounds, and speaks to MRM about them in letters, though I didn't find any such quotes in his published works.--> <rs type="animal" ref="greyhound"><rs type="person" ref="#Great_Farmhouse_farmer_OV">Our friend</rs>’s large dogs</rs> were a fine illustration of this remark. His old <rs type="animal" ref="#dog">dog</rs>, <rs type="animal" ref="#Hector_pet_OV">Hector</rs>, for instance, for whom he refused a hundred guineas,—what a superb dog was Hector!—a model of grace and symmetry, necked and crested like an Arabian, and bearing himself with a stateliness and gallantry that showed some <quote>“conscience of his worth.”</quote><!--SCW: This may be a mis-quote from The Tragedies of Sophocles, tr. R. Potter, Oxford, Bliss and Baxter, 1813, referring to Philoctetes, p.297. Actual quote is "conscious of his worth." It also sounds familiar to me, but perhaps from MRM herself elsewhere, so fie on all!--> He was the largest <rs type="animal" ref="#Hector_pet_OV">dog</rs> I ever saw; but so finely proportioned, that the most determined fault-finder could call him neither too long nor too heavy. There was not an inch too much of him. His colour was the purest white, entirely unspotted, except that his head was very regularly and richly marked with black. <rs type="animal" ref="#Hector_pet)OV">Hector</rs> was certainly a perfect beauty. But the little <rs type="animal" ref="#dog">bitches</rs>, on which <rs type="person" ref="#Great_Farmhouse_farmer_OV">his master</rs> piqued himself still more, were not in my poor judgment so admirable. They were pretty little round, graceful things, sleek and glossy, and for the most part milk-white, with the smallest heads, and the most dove-like eyes that were ever seen. There was a<pb n="52"/> peculiar sort of innocent beauty about them, like that of a roly-poly child. They were as gentle as lambs too: all the evil spirit of the family evaporated in the gentlemen. But, to my thinking, these pretty creatures were fitter for the parlour than the field. They were strong, certainly, excellently loined, cat-footed, and chested like a war-horse; but there was a want of length about them—a want of room, as the coursers say; something a little, a very little inclining to the clumsy; a dumpiness, a pointer-look. They went off like an arrow from a bow; for the first hundred yards nothing could stand against them; then they began to flag, to find their weight too much for their speed, and to lose ground from the shortness of the stroke. Up-hill, however, they were capital. They turned with the <rs type="animal" ref="#hare">hare</rs>, and lost neither wind nor way in the sharpest ascent. I shall never forget one single-handed course of <rs type="person" ref="#Great_Farmhouse_farmer)OV">our good friend</rs>’s favourite little bitch <rs type="animal" ref="#Helen_pet_OV">Helen</rs>, on <placeName ref="#W_Hill">W. Hill</placeName>. All the <orgName type="animal" ref="#greyhounds">coursers</orgName> were in the valley below, looking up to the hill side as on a moving picture. I suppose she turned the <rs type="animal" ref="#hare">hare</rs> twenty times on a piece of <rs type="nature" ref="#greensward">greensward</rs> not much bigger than an acre, and as steep as the roof of a house. It was an old <rs type="animal" ref="#hare">hare</rs>, a famous <rs type="animal" ref="#hare">hare</rs>, one that had baffled half the dogs in the county; but <rs type="animal" ref="#Helen_pet_OV">she</rs> killed him; and then, though almost as large as herself, took it up in her mouth, brought it to her<pb n="53"/> master, and laid it down at his feet. Oh how pleased he was! and what a pleasure it was to see his triumph! He did not always find <placeName ref="#W_Hill">W. Hill</placeName> so fortunate. It is a high steep hill, of a conical shape, encircled by a mountain road winding up to the summit like a cork-screw,—a deep road dug out of the chalk, and fenced by high mounds on either side. The <rs type="animal" ref="#hare">hares</rs> always make for this hollow way, as it is called, because it is too wide for a leap, and the <rs type="animal" ref="#dog">dogs</rs> lose much time in mounting and descending the sharp acclivities. Very eager <rs type="animal" ref="#dog">dogs</rs> will sometimes dare the leap, and two of <rs type="person" ref="#Great_Farmhouse_farmer_OV">our good friend</rs>’s favourite <rs type="animal" ref="#greyhound">greyhounds</rs> perished in the attempt in two following years. They were found dead in the hollow way. After this he took a dislike to distant coursing meetings, and sported chiefly on his own beautiful farm.</p>
                <p><rs type="person" ref="#Great_Farmhouse_wife_OV">His wife</rs> was like <rs type="person" ref="#Great_Farmhouse_farmer_OV">her husband</rs>, with a difference, as they say in heraldry. Like him in looks, only thinner and paler; like him in voice and phrase, only not so loud; like him in merriment and good-humour; like him in her talent of welcoming and making happy, and being kind; like him in cherishing an abundance of pets, and in getting through with marvellous facility an astounding quantity of business and pleasure. Perhaps the quality in which they resembled each other most completely, was the happy ease and serenity of behaviour, so seldom found amongst people of the mid<pb n="54"/>dle rank, who have usually a best manner and a worst, and whose best (that is the studied, the company manner) is so very much the worst. She was frankness itself; entirely free from prickly defiance, or bristling self-love. She never took offence or gave it; never thought of herself or of what others would think of her; had never been afflicted with the besetting sins of her station, a dread of the vulgar, or an aspiration after the genteel. Those <quote>“words of fear”</quote><!--SCW: Still unidentified--> had never disturbed her delightful heartiness.</p>
                <p>Her pets were her <rs type="animal" ref="#cow">cows</rs>, her <rs type="animal" ref="#poultry">poultry</rs>, her <rs type="animal" ref="#bee">bees</rs>, and her flowers; chiefly her <rs type="animal" ref="#poultry">poultry</rs>, almost as numerous as the <rs type="animal" ref="#bee">bees</rs>, and as various as the flowers. The farmyard swarmed with <rs type="animal" ref="#peacock">peacocks</rs>, <rs type="animal" ref="#turkey">turkeys</rs>, <rs type="animal" ref="#geese">geese</rs>, <rs type="animal" ref="#duck">tame and wild-ducks</rs>, <rs type="animal" ref="#fowl">fowls</rs>, <rs type="animal" ref="#guinea_hen">guinea-hens</rs>, and <rs type="animal" ref="#pigeon">pigeons</rs>; besides a brood or two of favourite <rs type="animal" ref="#bantam">bantams</rs> in the green court before the door, with a little ridiculous strutter of a <rs type="animal" ref="#rooster">cock</rs> at their head, who imitated the magnificent demeanour of the great <rs type="animal" ref="#turkey">Tom</rs> of the barn-yard, just as <rs type="animal" ref="#turkey">Tom</rs> in his turn copied the fierce bearing of that warlike and terrible biped the <rs type="animal" ref="#turkey">he-turkey</rs>. I am the least in the world afraid of a <rs type="animal" ref="#turkey">turkey-cock</rs>, and used to steer clear of the turkery as often as I could. Commend me to the peaceable vanity of that jewel of a bird the <rs type="animal" ref="#peacock">peacock</rs>, sweeping his gorgeous tail along the grass, or dropping it gracefully from some low-boughed tree, whilst he turns round his crested head with the air of a birth-day<pb n="55"/> belle, to see who admires him. What a glorious creature it is! How thoroughly content with himself and with all the world!</p>
                <p>Next to her <rs type="animal" ref="#chicken">poultry</rs> our good farmer’s wife loved her flower-garden; and indeed it was of the very first water, the only thing about the place that was fine. She was a real genuine florist; valued <rs type="plant" ref="#pink">pinks</rs>, <rs type="plant" ref="#tulip">tulips</rs>, and <rs type="plant" ref="#auricula">auriculas</rs>, for certain qualities of shape and colour, with which beauty has nothing to do; preferred black <rs type="plant" ref="#ranunculuses">ranunculuses</rs>, and gave into all those obliquities of a triple-refined taste by which the professed florist contrives to keep pace with the vagaries of the Bibliomaniac. Of all odd fashions, that of dark, gloomy, dingy flowers, appears to me the oddest. Your true <emph>connoisseur</emph> now, shall prefer a deep puce <rs type="plant" ref="#hollyhock">hollyhock</rs>, to the gay pink <rs type="plant" ref="#blossom">blossoms</rs> which cluster round that splendid plant like a pyramid of <rs type="plant" ref="#rose">roses</rs>. So did she. The nomenclature of her garden was more distressing still. One is never thoroughly sociable with flowers till they are naturalized as it were, christened, provided with decent, homely, well-wearing English names. Now her plants had all sorts of heathenish appellations, which,—no offence to her learning,—always sounded wrong. I liked the <rs type="animal" ref="#bee">bees</rs>’ garden best; the plot of ground immediately round their hives, filled with common flowers for their use, and literally <quote>“redolent of sweets.”</quote><!--SCW: Many quotes like this, arrrgh.--> <rs type="animal" ref="#bee">Bees</rs> are insects of great taste in every way, and seem often to se<pb n="56"/>lect for beauty as much as for flavour. They have a better eye for colour than the florist. The butterfly is also <emph>dilettante</emph>. Rover though he be, he generally perfers the <rs type="flower" ref="#blossom">blossoms</rs> that become him best. What a pretty picture it is, in a sunshiny autumn day, to see a bright spotted <rs type="animal" ref="#butterfly">butterfly</rs>, made up of gold and purple and splendid brown, swinging on the rich flower of the <rs type="flower" ref="#China_Aster">china aster</rs>!</p>
                <p>To come back to our farm. Within doors every thing went as well as without. There were no fine misses sitting before the piano, and mixing the alloy of their new-fangled tinsel with the old sterling metal; nothing but an <rs type="person" ref="#Great_Farmhouse_son_OV">only son</rs> excellently brought up, a fair slim youth, whose extraordinary and somewhat pensive elegance of mind and manner was thrown into fine relief by <rs type="person" ref="#Great_Farmhouse_farmer_OV">his father</rs>’s loud hilarity, and harmonised delightfully with the smiling kindness of <rs type="person" ref="#Great_Farmhouse_wife_OV">his mother</rs>. His <persName ref="#Spenser_Edmund">Spensers</persName> and <persName ref="#Thomson_James">Thomsons</persName>, too, looked well amongst the <rs type="plant" ref="#hyacinth">hyacinths</rs> and <rs type="plant" ref="#geranium">geraniums</rs> that filled the windows of the little snug room in which they usually sate; a sort of after-thought, built at an angle from the house, and looking into the farm-yard. It was closely packed with favourite arm-chairs, favourite sofas, favourite tables, and a sideboard decorated with the prize-cups and collars of the greyhounds, and generally loaded with substantial work-baskets, jars of flowers, great pyramids of home-made cakes, and sparkling bottles of goose<pb n="57"/>berry-wine, famous all over the country. The walls were covered with portraits of half a dozen greyhounds, a brace of <rs type="animal" ref="#spaniel">spaniels</rs>, as large as life, an old <rs type="animal" ref="#pony">pony</rs>, and the master and mistress of the house in half-length. She as unlike as possible, prim, mincing, delicate, in lace and satin; he so staringly and ridiculously like, that when the picture fixed its good-humoured eyes upon you as you entered the room, you were almost tempted to say—How d’ye do?—Alas! the portraits are now gone, and the originals. Death and distance have despoiled that pleasant home. The garden has lost its <rs type="person" ref="#Great_Farmhouse_wife_OV">smiling mistress</rs>; the <rs type="animal" ref="greyhound">greyhounds</rs> their <rs type="person" ref="#Great_Farmhouse_farmer_OV">kind master</rs>; and new people, new manners, and new cares, have taken possession of the old abode of peace and plenty—the great farm-house.<pb n="58"/></p>

Virgil refers to a Roman superstition that elms were trees of ill-omen because their fruit seemed to have no value. Two elm-motifs have risen from classical literature: the 'Paradisal elm' motif, representing pastoral idylls, and the 'Elm and Death' motif. Many references to elm from the Renaissance onwards fit one of these two categories.</note></item>
