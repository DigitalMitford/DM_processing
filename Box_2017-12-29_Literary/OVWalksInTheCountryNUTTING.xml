            <p>September 26th.—One of those delicious autumnal days, when the air, the sky, and the
               earth, seem lulled into an universal calm, softer and milder even than May. We
               sallied forth for a walk, in a mood congenial to the weather and the season,
               avoiding, by mutual consent, the bright and sunny common, and the gay high road, and
               stealing through shady unfrequented lanes, where we were not likely to meet any
               one,—not even the pretty family procession which in other years we used to
               contemplate with so much interest—the father, mother, and children, returning from
               the wheat-field, the little ones laden with bristling close-tied bunches of
               wheat-ears, their own gleanings, or a bottle and a basket which had contained their
               frugal dinner, whilst the mother would carry her babe hushing and lulling it, and the
               father and an elder child trudged after with the cradle, all seeming<pb n="242"/>
               weary, and all happy. We shall not see such a procession as this to-day; for the
               harvest is nearly over, the fields are deserted, the silence may almost be felt.
               Except the wintry notes of the red-breast, nature herself is mute. But how beautiful,
               how gentle, how harmonious, how rich! The rain has preserved to the herbage all the
               freshness and verdure of spring, and the world of leaves has lost nothing of its
               midsummer brightness, and the hare-bell is on the banks and the woodbine in the
               hedges, and the low furze, which the lambs cropped in the spring, has burst again
               into its golden blossoms.</p>
            <p>All is beautiful that the eye can see; perhaps the more beautiful for being shut in
               with a forest-like closeness. We have no prospect in this labyrinth of lanes,
               cross-roads, mere cart-ways, leading to the innumerable little farms into which this
               part of the parish is divided. Uphill or down, these quiet woody lanes scarcely give
               us a peep at the world, except when, leaning over a gate, we look into one of the
               small enclosures, hemmed in with hedgerows, so closely set with growing timber, that
               the meady opening looks almost like a glade in a wood, or when some cottage, planted
               at a corner of one of the little greens formed by the meeting of these cross-ways,
               almost startles us by the unexpected sight of the dwellings of men in such a
               solitude. But that we have more of hill and<pb n="243"/> dale, and that our
               cross-roads are excellent in their kind, this side of our parish would resemble the
               description given of La Vendée, in Madame Laroche-jacquelin’s most interesting book
                  *<note type="author" anchored="true">* An almost equally interesting account of
                  that very peculiar and interesting scenery, may be found in “The Maid of La
                  Vendée,” an English novel, remarkable for its simplicity and truth of painting,
                  written by Mrs. Le Noir, tbe daughter of Christopher Smart, and inheritrix of much
                  of his talent. Her works deserve to be better known.</note>. I am sure if wood can
               entitle a country to be called Le Bocage, none can have a better right to the name.
               Even this pretty snug farm-house on the hill side, with its front covered with the
               rich vine, which goes wreathing up to the very top of the clustered chimney, and its
               sloping orchard full of fruit—even this pretty quiet nest can hardly peep out of its
               leaves. Ah! they are gathering in the orchard-harvest. Look at that young rogue in
               the old mossy apple-tree—that great tree, bending with the weight of its
               golden-rennets—see how he pelts his little sister beneath with apples as red and as
               round as her own cheeks, while she, with her outstretched frock, is trying to catch
               them, and laughing and offering to pelt again as often as one bobs against her; and
               look at that still younger imp, who, as grave as a judge, is creeping on hands and
               knees under the tree, picking up the apples as they fall so<pb n="244"/> deedily
                  *<note type="author" anchored="true">*“Deedily,”—I am not quite sure that this
                  word is good English; but it is genuine Hampshire, and is used by the most correct
                  of female writers, Miss Austen. It means (and it is no small merit that it has no
                  exact synonyme) any thing done with a profound and plodding attention, an action
                  which engrosses all the powers of mind and body.</note>, and depositing them so
               honestly in the great basket on the grass, already fixed so firmly and opened so
               widely, and filled almost to overflowing by the brown rough fruitage of the golden
               rennet’s next neighbour the russeting; and see that smallest urchin of all seated
               apart in infantine state on the turfy bank, with that toothsome piece of deformity a
               crumpling in each hand, now biting from one sweet hard juicy morsel, and now from
               another.—Is not that a pretty English picture? And then, farther up the orchard, that
               bold hardy lad, the eldest-born, who has scaled (Heaven knows how!) the tall straight
               upper branch of that great pear-tree, and is sitting there as securely and as
               fearlessly, in as much real safety and apparent danger, as a sailor on the top-mast.
               Now he shakes the tree with a mighty swing that brings down a pelting shower of stony
               bergamots, which the father gathers rapidly up, whilst the mother can hardly assist
               for her motherly fear,—a fear which only spurs the spirited boy to bolder ventures.
               Is not that a pretty picture? And they are such a handsome family, too,<pb n="245"/>
               the Brookers. I do not know that there is any gipsey blood, but there is the true
               gipsey complexion, richly brown, with cheeks and lips so deeply red, black hair
               curling close to their heads in short crisp rings, white shining teeth—and such
               eyes!—That sort of beauty entirely eclipses your mere roses and lilies. Even Lizzy,
               the prettiest of fair children, would look poor and watery by the side of Willy
               Brooker, the sober little personage who is picking up the apples with his small
               chubby hands, and filling the basket so orderly, next to his father the most useful
               man in the field. “Willy!” He hears without seeing; for we are quite hidden by the
               high bank, and a spreading hawthorn-bush that overtops it, though between the lower
               branches and the grass we have found a convenient peep-hole. “Willy!” The voice
               sounds to him like some fairy dream, and the black eyes are raised from the ground
               with sudden wonder, the long silky eye-lashes thrown back till they rest on the
               delicate brow, and a deeper blush is burning in those dark cheeks, and a smile is
               dimpling about those scarlet lips. But the voice is silent now, and the little quiet
               boy, after a moment’s pause, is gone coolly to work again. He is indeed a most lovely
               child. I think some day or other he must marry Lizzy; I shall propose the match to
               their respective mammas. At present the parties are rather too young for a
                  wedding—the<pb n="246"/> intended bridegroom being, as I should judge, six, or
               thereabout, and the fair bride barely five,—but at least we might have a betrothment
               after the royal fashion,—there could be no harm in that. Miss Lizzy, I have no doubt,
               would be as demure and coquettish as if ten winters more had gone over her head, and
               poor Willy would open his innocent black eyes, and wonder what was going forward.
               They would be the very Oberon and Titania of the village, the fairy king and
               queen.</p>
            <p>Ah! here is the hedge along which the periwinkle wreathes and twines so profusely,
               with its ever-green leaves shining like the myrtle, and its starry blue flowers. It
               is seldom found wild in this part of England; but, when we do meet with it, it is so
               abundant and so welcome,—the very robin-redbreast of flowers, a winter friend. Unless
               in those unfrequent frosts which destroy all vegetation, it blossoms from September
               to June, surviving the last lingering crane’s-bill, forerunning the earliest
               primrose, hardier even than the mountain daisy,—peeping out from beneath the snow,
               looking at itself in the ice, smiling through the tempests of life,and yet welcoming
               and enjoying the sunbeams. Oh, to be like that flower!</p>
            <p>The little spring that has been bubbling under the hedge all along the hill-side,
               begins, now that we have mounted the eminence and are imperceptibly descending, to
               deviate into a capricious variety of clear deep<pb n="247"/> pools and channels, so
               narrow and so choked with weeds, that a child might overstep them. The hedge has also
               changed its character. It is no longer the close compact vegetable wall of hawthorn,
               and maple, and briar roses, intertwined with bramble and woodbine, and crowned with
               large elms or thickly set saplings. No! the pretty meadow which rises high above us,
               backed and almost surrounded by a tall coppice, needs no defence on our side but its
               own steep bank, garnished with tufts of broom, with pollard oaks wreathed with ivy,
               and here and there with long patches of hazel overhanging the water. “Ah there are
               still nuts on that bough!” and in an instant my dear companion, active and eager and
               delighted as a boy, has hooked down with his walking-stick one of the lissome hazel
               stalks, and cleared it of its tawny clusters, and in another moment he has mounted
               the bank, and is in the midst of the nuttery, now transferring the spoil from the
               lower branches into that vast variety of pockets which gentlemen carry about them,
               now bending the tall tops into the lane, holding them down by main force, so that I
               might reach them and enjoy the pleasure of collecting some of the plunder myself. A
               very great pleasure he knew it would be. I doffed my shawl, tucked up my flounces,
               turned my straw bonnet into a basket, and began gathering and scrambling—for, manage
               it how you may, nutting is scrambling work,—those boughs,<pb n="248"/> however
               tightly you may grasp them by the young fragrant twigs and the bright green leaves,
               will recoil and burst away; but there is a pleasure even in that; so on we go,
               scrambling and gathering with all our might and all our glee. Oh what an enjoyment!
               All my life long I have had a passion for that sort of seeking which implies finding,
               (the secret, I believe, of the love of field-sports, which is in man’s mind a natural
               impulse,)—therefore I love violeting,—therefore, when we had a fine garden I used to
               love to gather strawberries, and cut asparagus, and, above all, to collect the
               filberts from the shrubberies: but this hedge-row nutting beats that sport all to
               nothing. That was a make-believe thing, compared with this; there was no surprise, no
               suspense, no unexpectedness—it was as inferior to this wild nutting, as the turning
               out of a bag-fox is to unearthing the fellow in the eyes of a stanch fox-hunter.</p>
            <p>Oh what an enjoyment this nut-gathering is! They are in such abundance, that it seems
               as if there were not a boy in the parish, nor a young man, nor a young woman,—for a
               basket of nuts is the universal tribute of country gallantry; our pretty damsel
               Harriet has had at least half a dozen this season; but no one has found out these.
               And they are so full too, we lose half of them from over-ripeness; they drop from the
               socket at the slightest motion. If we lose, there is one who<pb n="249"/> finds. May
               is as fond of nuts as a squirrel, and cracks the shell and extracts the kernel with
               equal dexterity. Her white glossy head is upturned now to watch them as they fall.
               See how her neck is thrown back like that of a swan, and how beautifully her folded
               ears quiver with expectation, and how her quick eye follows the rustling noise, and
               her light feet dance and pat the ground, and leap up with eagerness, seeming almost
               sustained in the air, just as I have seen her when Brush is beating a hedgerow, and
               she knows from his questing that there is a hare afoot. See, she has caught that nut
               just before it touched the water; but the water would have been no defence,—she
               fishes them from the bottom, she delves after them amongst the matted grass—even my
               bonnet—how beggingly she looks at that! “Oh what a pleasure nutting is!—Is it not,
               May? But the pockets are almost full, and so is the basket-bonnet, and that bright
               watch the sun says it is late;—and after all it is wrong to rob the poor
               boys—‘pleasant but wrong’—is it not, May?”—May shakes her graceful head denyingly, as
               if she understood the question—“And we must go home now—must we not? But we will come
               nutting again some time or other—shall we not, my May?”</p>
