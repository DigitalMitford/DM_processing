            </head>
            <p>I do not know whether I ever hinted to the courteous reader that I had been in my
               younger days, without prejudice to my present condition, somewhat of a spoiled child.
               The person who, next after my father and mother, contributed most materially to this
               melancholy catastrophe, was an old female domestic, Mrs. Elizabeth Mosse, who, at the
               time of her death, had lived nearly sixty years in our house and that of my maternal
               grandfather. Of course, during the latter part of this long period, the common forms
               and feelings of servant and master were entirely swept away. She was a member of the
               family, an humble friend—happy are they who have such a friend!—living as she liked
               up-stairs or down, in the kitchen or the nursery, considered, consulted, and beloved
               by the whole household.</p>
            <p>Mossy (for by that fondling nursery name she best liked to be called) had never been
               married, so that the<pb n="221"/> family of her master and mistress had no rival in
               her heart, and on me, their only child, was concentrated that intensity of affection
               which distinguishes the attachments of age. I loved her dearly too, as dearly as a
               spoiled child can love its prime spoiler,—but, oh! how selfish was my love, compared
               to the depth, the purity, the indulgence, the self-denial of hers! Dear Mossy! I
               shall never do her justice; and yet I must try.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Mosse, in her appearance, was in the highest degree what is called respectable.
               She must have been tall when young; for even when bent with age, she was above the
               middle height, a large-made though meagre woman. She walked with feebleness and
               difficulty, from the attacks of hereditary gout, which not even her temperance and
               activity could ward off. There was something very interesting in this tottering
               helplessness, clinging to the balusters, or holding by doors and chairs like a child.
               It had nothing of vulgar lameness; it told of age, venerable age. Out of doors she
               seldom ventured, unless on some sunny afternoon I could entice her into the air, and
               then once round the garden, or to the lawn gate and back again, was the extent of her
               walk, propped by a very aristocratic walking-stick (once the property of a duchess)
               as tall as herself, with a hooked ivory handle, joined to the cane by a rim of gold.
               Her face was as venerable<pb n="222"/> as her person. She must have been very
               handsome; indeed she was so still, as far as regular and delicate features, a pale
               brown complexion, dark eyes still retaining the intelligence and animation of youth,
               and an expression perfectly gentle and feminine, could make her so. It is one of the
               worst penalties that woman pays to age, that often, when advanced in life, the face
               loses its characteristic softness; in short, but for the difference in dress, many an
               old woman’s head might pass for that of an old man. This misfortune could never have
               happened to Mossy. No one could mistake the sex of that sweet countenance.</p>
            <p>Her dress manifested a good deal of laudable coquetry, a nice and minute attention to
               the becoming. I do not know at what precise date her costume was fixed: but, as long
               as I remember her, fixed it was, and stood as invariably at one point of fashion, as
               the hand of an unwound clock stands at one hour of the day. It consisted (to begin
               from the feet and describe upwards) of black shoes of shining stuff, with very
               pointed toes, high heels, and a peak up the instep, showing to advantage her
               delicately white cotton stockings, and peeping beneath petticoats so numerous and
               substantial, as to give a rotundity and projection almost equal to a hoop. Her
               exterior garment was always quilted, varying according to the season or the occasion
               from simple stuff, or fine white dimity, or an obsolete<pb n="223"/> manufacture
               called Marseilles, up to silk and satin;— for, as the wardrobes of my three
               grandmothers (pshaw! I mean my grandfather’s three wives!) had fallen to her lot, few
               gentlewomen of the last century could boast a greater variety of silks that stood on
               end. Over the quilted petticoat came an open gown, whose long waist reached to the
               bottom of her stiff stays, and whose very full tail, about six inches longer than the
               petticoat, would have formed a very inconvenient little train, if it had been
               permitted to hang down; but that inconvenience never happened, and could scarcely
               have been contemplated by the designer. The tail was constantly looped up, so as to
               hang behind in a sort of bunchy festoon, exhibiting on each side the aforesaid
               petticoat. In material the gown also varied with the occasion, although it was always
               either composed of dark cotton or of the rich silks and satins of my grandmamma’s
               wardrobe. The sleeves came down just below the elbow, and were finished by a narrow
               white ruffle meeting her neat mittens. On her neck she wore a snow-white double
               muslin kerchief, pinned over the gown in front, and confined by an apron also of
               muslin; and, over all, a handsome silk shawl, so pinned back as to show a part of the
               snowy neck-kerchief. Her head-dress was equally becoming, and more particularly
               precise; for, if ever she betrayed an atom of old-maidishness, it was on the score of
               her caps. From<pb n="224"/> a touch of the gout in her hands, which had enlarged and
               stiffened the joints, she could do no work which required nicety, and the successive
               lady’s maids, on whom the operation devolved, used to say that they would rather make
               up ten caps for their mistress than one for Mrs. Mosse; and yet the construction
               seemed simple enough. A fine plain clear-starched caul, sticking up rather high and
               peaked in front, was plaited on a Scotch gauze headpiece; (I remember there used to
               be exactly six plaits on each side—woe to the damsel who should put more or less!)
               and, on the other side, a border, consisting of a strip of fine muslin, edged with
               narrow lace, clear-starched and crimped, was plaited on with equal precision. In one
               part of this millinery I used to assist. I dearly loved to crimp Mossy’s frills, and
               she with her usual indulgence used frequently to let me, keeping however a pretty
               close eye on her laces and muslins, whilst I was passing them with triumphant
               rapidity between the small wooden machine notched longitudinally, and the
               corresponding roller. Perhaps a greater proof of indulgence could hardly have been
               shewn, since she must, during this operation, have been in double fear for her own
               cap strips, which did occasionally get a rent, and for my fingers, which were
               sometimes well pinched—then she would threaten that I should never crimp her muslin
               again—a never which seldom lasted beyond the next<pb n="225"/> cap-making. The
               head-piece was then concealed by a satin riband fastened in a peculiar bow, something
               between a bow and a puffing behind, whilst the front was adorned with an equally
               peculiar small knot, of which the two bows were pinned down flat and the two ends
               left sticking up, cut into scallops of a prodigious regularity. The purchase of the
               ribands formed another branch of the cap-making department to which I laid claim.
               From the earliest period at which I could distinguish one colour from another, I had
               been purveyor of ribands to Mossy, and indeed at all fairs, or whenever I received a
               present or entered a shop, (and I was so liberally supplied that there was nothing
               like generosity in the case,) it was the first and pleasantest destination of money
               that occurred to me;—so that the dear woman used to complain, that Miss bought her so
               many ribands, that they spoiled in keeping. We did not quite agree either in our
               taste. White, as both ac- knowledged, was the only wear for Sundays and holidays; but
               then she loved plain white, and I could not always control a certain wandering
               inclination for figured patterns and pearl edges. If Mossy had an aversion to any
               thing, it was to a pearl edge. I never could persuade her to wear that simple piece
               of finery but once; and then she made as many wry faces as a child eating olives, and
               stood before a glass eyeing the obnoxious riband with so much discomposure, that I<pb
                  n="226"/> was fain to take it out myself, and promise to buy no more pearl edges.
               The every-day ribands were coloured; and there, too, we had our little differences of
               taste and opinion. Both agreed in the propriety of grave colours; but then my reading
               of a grave colour was not always the same as hers. My eyes were not old enough. She
               used to accuse my French greys of blueness, and my crimsons of redness, and my greens
               of their greenness. She had a penchant for brown, and to brown I had a repugnance
               only to be equalled by that which she professed towards a pearl edge;—indeed I retain
               my dislike to this hour;—it is such an exceedingly cross and frumpish-looking
               colour—and then its ugliness! Show me a brown flower! No! I could not bring myself to
               buy brown;—so after fighting many battles about grey and green, we at last settled on
               purple as a sort of neutral tint, a hue which pleased both parties. To return to the
               cap which we have been so long making—the finish both to that and to my description
               was a strip of crimped muslin, with edging on both sides to match the border, quilled
               on a piece of tape, and fastened on a cap at each ear. This she called the chinnum. A
               straight short row of hair rather grey, but still very dark for her age, just
               appeared under the plaited lace; and a pair of silver-mounted spectacles completed
               her equipment. If I live to the age of seventy, I will dress so too, with an
                  exception<pb n="227"/> of the stiff stays. Only a waist native to the fashion
               could endure that whalebone armour.</p>
            <p>Her employments were many and various. No work was required of her from her mistress;
               but idleness was misery to her habits of active usefulness, and it was astonishing
               how much those crippled fingers could do. She preferred coarse needle-work, as it was
               least difficult to her eyes and hands; and she attended also to those numerous and
               undefined avoca- tions of a gentleman’s family which come under the denomination of
               odd jobs—shelling peas, paring ap- ples, splitting French beans, washing china,
               darning stockings, hemming and mending dusters and housecloths, making cabbage-nets,
               and knitting garters. These were her daily avocations, the amusements which she
               loved. The only more delicate operation of needle-work that she ever undertook was
               the making of pincushions, a manufacture in which she delighted—not the quips and
               quiddities of these degenerate days, little bits of riband, and pasteboard, and gilt
               paper, in the shape of books or butterflies, by which, at charitable repositaries,
               half-a-dozen pins are smuggled into a lady’s pocket, and shillings and half-crowns
               are smuggled out;—no! Mossy’s were real solid old-fashioned silken pincushions, such
               as Autolycus might have carried about amongst his pedlery-ware, square and roomy, and
               capable, at a moderate<pb n="228"/> computation, of containing a whole paper of
               short-whites, and another of middlings. It was delightful to observe her enjoyment of
               this play-work; the conscious importance with which she produced her satins and
               brocades, and her cards of sewing silks (she generally made a whole batch at
               once)—the deliberation with which she assorted the colours;—the care with which she
               tacked and fitted side to side, and corner to corner;—the earnestness with which,
               when all was sewed up except one small aperture for the insertion of the stuffing,
               she would pour in the bran, or stow in the wool;—then the care with which she poked
               the stuffing into every separate corner, ramming it down with all her strength, and
               making the little bag (so to say) hold more than it would hold, until it became
               almost as hard as a cricket-ball;—then how she drew the aperture together by main
               force, putting so many last stitches, fastening off with such care;—and then
               distributing them to all around her (for her ladylike spirit would have scorned the
               idea of selling them), and always reserving the gayest and the prettiest for me. Dear
               old soul! I have several of them still.</p>
            <p>But, if I should begin to enumerate all the instances of kindness which I experienced
               at her hands, through the changes and varieties of troublesome childhood and
               fantastic youth; from the time when I was a puling baby, to the still more exacting
               state of a young<pb n="229"/> girl at home in the holidays, I should never know when
               to end. Her sweet and loving temper was self-rewarded. She enjoyed the happiness she
               gave. Those were pleasant evenings when my father and mother were engaged in the
               Christmas-dinner visits of a gay and extensive neighbourhood, and Mrs. Mosse used to
               put on her handsomest shawl and her kindest smile, and totter up stairs to drink tea
               with me, and keep me company. From those evenings I imbibed, in the first place, a
               love of strong green tea, for which gentle-womanly excitation Mossy had a remarkable
               predilection; secondly, a very discreditable and unlady-like partiality, of which I
               am quite ashamed, which I keep a secret from my most intimate friends, and would not
               mention for the world—a sort of sneaking kindness for her favourite game of cribbage;
               an old-fashioned vulgarity, which, in my mind, beats the genteeler pastimes of whist
               and picquet, and every game, except quadrille, out and out. I make no exception in
               favour of chess, because, thanks to my stupidity, I never could learn that recondite
               diversion; moreover, judging from the grave faces and fatiguing silence of the
               initiated, I cannot help suspecting that, board for board, we cribbage-players are as
               well amused as they. Dear Mossy could neither feel to deal and shuffle, nor see to
               peg; so that the greater part of the business fell to my share. The<pb n="230"/>
               success was pretty equally divided. Three rubbers were our stint; and we were often
               game and game in the last before victory declared itself. She was very anxious to
               beat, certainly—(N.B. we never played for any thing)—she liked to win; and yet she
               did not quite like that I should lose. If we could both have won—if it had been
               four-handed cribbage, and she my partner—still there would have been somebody to be
               beaten and pitied, but then that somebody would not have been “Miss.”</p>
            <p>The cribbage hour was pleasant; but I think the hours of chat which preceded and
               followed it were pleasanter still. Mossy was a most agreeable companion, sensible,
               modest, simple, shrewd, with an exactness of recollection, an honesty of memory, that
               gave exceeding interest to her stories. You were sure that you heard the truth. There
               was one striking peculiarity in her manner of talking, or rather one striking
               contrast. The voice and accent were quite those of a gentlewoman, as sweet-toned and
               correct as could be; the words and their arrangement were altogether those of a
               common person, provincial and ungrammatical in every phrase and combination. I
               believe it is an effect of association, from the little slips in her grammar, that I
               have contracted a most unscholar-like prejudice in favour of false syntax, which is
               so connected in my mind with right notions, that I<pb n="231"/> no sooner catch the
               sound of bad English than I begin to listen for good sense; and really they often go
               together (always supposing that the bad English be not of the order called slang),
               they meet much more frequently than those exclusive people, ladies and gentlemen, are
               willing to allow. In her they were always united. But the charm of her conversation
               was in the old family stories, and the unconscious peeps at old manners which they
               afforded.</p>
            <p>My grandfather, with whom she had lived in his first wife’s time, full twenty years
               before my mother’s birth, was a most respectable clergyman, who, after passing a few
               years in London amongst the wits and poets of the day, seeing the star of Pope in its
               decline, and that of Johnson in its rise, had retired into the country, where he held
               two adjoining livings of considerable value, both of which he served for above forty
               years, until the duty becoming too severe, he resigned one of them under an
               old-fashioned notion, that he who did the duty ought to receive the remuneration. I
               am very proud of my venerable ancestor. We have a portrait of him taken shortly after
               he was ordained, in his gown and band, with a curious flowing wig, something like
               that of a judge, fashionable doubtless, at the time, but which at present rather
               discomposes one’s notions of clerical costume. He seems to have been a dark little
               man, with a sensible counte<pb n="232"/>nance, and a pair of black eyes, that even in
               the picture look you through. He was a votary of the Muses, too; a contributor to
               Lewis’s Miscellany; (did my readers ever hear of that collection?) translated Horace,
               as all gentlemen do; and wrote love-verses, which had the unusual good fortune of
               obtaining their object, being, as Mrs. Mosse was wont to affirm, the chief engine and
               implement by which at fifty he gained the heart of his third wife, my real
               grandmamma, the beautiful daughter of a neighbouring ‘squire. Of Dr. R., his wives,
               and his sermons, the bishops who visited, and the poets who wrote to him, Mossy’s
               talk was mainly composed; chiefly of the wives.</p>
            <p>Mrs. R., the first, was a fine London lady, a widow, and considerably older than her
               spouse, inasmuch as my grand-papa’s passion for her commenced when he and her son, by
               a former husband, were school-fellows at Westminster. Mrs. Mosse never talked much of
               her, and, I suspect, did not much like her, though, when closely questioned, she
               would say that madam was a fine, portly lady, stately and personable, but rather too
               high. Her son made a sad mesalliance. He ran away with the sexton’s daughter, an
               adventure which cost the sexton his post, and his mother her pride: she never looked
               up after it. That disgrace, and a cold caught by bumping on a pillion six miles
               through the rain, sent her to her grave.</p>
            <pb n="233"/>
            <p>Of the second Mrs. R. little remains on record, except a gown and petticoat of
               primrose silk, curiously embossed and embroidered with gold and silver thread and
               silks of all colours, in an enormous running pattern of staring flowers, wonderfully
               unlike nature; also various recipes in the family receipt-book, which show a delicate
               Italian hand, and a bold originality of orthography. The chief event of her married
               life appears to have been the small-pox. She and two of her sisters, and Mrs. Mosse,
               were all inoculated together. The other servants, who had not gone through the
               disorder, were sent out of the house: Dr. R. himself took refuge with a neighbouring
               friend, and the patients were consigned to the care of two or three nurses, gossips
               by profession, hired from the next town. The best parlour, (in those days
               drawing-rooms were not) was turned into a hospital; a quarantine, almost as strict as
               would be required in the plague, was kept up, and the preparation, the disease, and
               the recovery, consumed nearly two months. Mrs. Mosse always spoke of it as one of the
               pleasantest passages of her life. None of them suffered much; there was nothing to
               do; plenty of gossiping; a sense of self-importance, such as all prisoners must feel
               more or less; and for amusement they had Pamela, the Spectator, and Sir Charles
               Grandison. My grandfather had a very fine library; but Sir Charles was a female<pb
                  n="234"/> book, having been purchased by the joint contributions of six young
               ladies, and circulated amongst them once a year, sojourning two months with each fair
               partner, till death or marriage broke up the coterie. Is not that fame?— Well the
               second Mrs. R. died in the course of time, though not of the small-pox; and my
               grandfather, faithful to his wives, but not to their memories, married again as
               usual.</p>
            <p>His third adventure in that line was particularly happy; for my grandmother, beside
               being a celebrated beauty, appears to have been one of the best and kindest women
               that ever gladdened a country-home. She had a large household; for the tithes of one
               rich rectory were taken in kind, and the glebe cultivated; so that the cares of a
               farm-house were added to the hospitality of a man of good fortune, and to the sort of
               stateliness which in those primitive days appertained to a doctor of divinity. The
               superintendance of that large household seems to have been at once her duty and her
               delight. It was a plenty and festivity almost resembling that of Camacho’s wedding,
               guided by a wise and liberal ceconomy, and a spirit of indefatigable industry. Oh the
               saltings, the picklings, the preservings, the cake-makings, the unnamed and
               unnameable confectionary doings over which she presided! The very titles of her
               terri- tories denoted the extent of her stores. The<pb n="235"/> apple-room, the
               pear-bin, the cheese-loft, the minced-meat closet, were household words as familiar
               in Mossy’s mouth as the dairy or the poultry-yard. And my grandmamma was no hoarder
               for hoarding’s sake, no maker of good things which were not to be eaten—as I have
               sometimes noted amongst your managing ladies; the object of her cares and stores was
               to contribute to the comfort of all who came within her influence. The large
               parsonage-house was generally overflowing with guests; and from the Oxford professor,
               who, with his wife, children, servants, and horses, passed his vacations there, to
               the poor pew-opener, who came with her little ones at tide-times, all felt the charm
               of her smiling graciousness, her sweet and cheerful spirit, her open hand and open
               heart. It is difficult to imagine a happier couple than my venerable grandfather and
               his charming wife. He retained to the last his studious habits, his love of
               literature, and his strong and warm family affections; while she cast the sunshine of
               her innocent gaiety over his respectable age, proud of his scholarship, and prouder
               still of his virtues. Both died long ago. But Mossy was an “honest chronicler,” and
               never weary of her theme. Even the daily airings of the good doctor (who, in spite of
               his three wives, had a little of the peculiar preciseness in his studies and his<pb
                  n="236"/> exercise, which one is apt to attribute exclusively to that dreary
               person, an old bachelor) even those airings from twelve to two, four miles on the
               turnpike-road and four miles back, with the fat horses and the grey-haired coachman,
               became vivid and characteristic in her description. The very carriage-dog, Sancho,
               was individualized; we felt that he belonged to the people and the time.</p>
            <p>Of these things we talked, mingled with many miscellaneous anecdotes of the same date
               ;—how an electioneering duke saluted madam, and lost master’s interest by the
               freedom; how Sir Thomas S., the Lovelace of his day, came in his chariot and six,
               full twenty miles out of his way, to show himself to Miss Fanny in a Spanish
               masquerade-dress, white satin slashed with blue, a blue cloak embroidered with
               silver, and point-lace that might have won any woman’s heart, except that of his fair
               but obdurate mistress; and lastly, how Henry Fielding, when on a visit in the
               neighbourhood, had been accustomed to come and swing the children in the great barn;
               he had even swung Mossy herself, to her no small edification and delight—only think
               of being chucked backwards and forwards by the man who wrote about Parson Adams and
               ‘Squire All- worthy! I used to envy her that felicity. Then from authors we got to
               books. She could not see in my time to read any thing but the folio Bible, and Com<pb
                  n="237"/>mon Prayer-Book, with which my dear mother had furnished her; but in her
               younger days she had seen or heard parts at least of a variety of books, and entered
               into them with a very keen though uncritical relish. Her chief favourites were, the
               Pilgrim’s Progress, Don Quixote, Gulliver’s Travels, Robinson Crusoe, and the equally
               apocryphal but still truer-seeming History of the Plague in London, by the same
               author, all of which she believed with the most earnest simplicity. I used frequently
               to read to her the passages she liked best; and she in her turn would repeat to me
               songs and ballads, good, bad, and indifferent—a strange medley, and strangely
               confounded in her memory; and so the time passed till ten o’clock. Those were
               pleasant evenings for her and for me.</p>
            <p>I have sometimes, on recollection, feared that her down-stair life was less happy.
               All that the orders of a mistress could effect for her comfort was done. But we were
               rich then unluckily; and there were skip-jacks of footmen, and surly coachmen, and
               affected waiting-maids, and vixenish cooks, with tempers red-hot like their coals, to
               vex and tease our dear old woman. She must have suffered greatly between her ardent
               zeal for her master’s interest, and that strange principle of concealing evil doings
               which servants call honour, and of which she was perpetually the slave<pb n="238"/>
               and the victim. She had another infirmity, too, an impossibility of saying no, which,
               added to an unbounded generosity of temper, rendered her the easy dupe of the artful
               and designing. She would give any thing to the appearance of want, or the pretence of
               affection; in short, to importunity, however clothed. It was the only point of
               weakness in her character; and to watch that she did not throw away her own little
               comforts, to protect her from the effects of her over-liberality, was the chief care
               of her mistress. Three inferior servants were successively turned away for
               trespassing on Mossy’s goodness, drinking her green tea, eating her diet-bread,
               begging her gowns. But the evil was incurable; she could dispense with any pleasure,
               except that of giving. So she lived on, beloved as the kind, the gentle, and the
               generous must be, till I left school—an event that gave her great satisfaction.</p>
            <p>We passed the succeeding spring in London; and she took the opportunity to pay a
               long-promised visit to a half-nephew and niece, or rather a half-niece and her
               husband, who lived in Prince’s-street, Barbican. Mrs. Beck (one naturally mentions
               her first as the person of most consequence) was the only real woman who ever came up
               to the magnificent abstract idea of the “fat woman of Brentford,” the only being for
               whom Sir John Falstaff might have passed undetected.<pb n="239"/> She was indeed a
               mountain of flesh, exuberant, rubicund, and bearded like a man; and she spoke, in a
               loud deep mannish voice, a broad Wiltshire dialect; but she was hearty and jovial
               withal, a thorough good-fellow in petticoats. Mr. Beck, on the other hand, was a
               little, insignificant, perking, sharp-featured man, with a Jerry-Sneak expression in
               his pale whey-face, a thin squeaking voice, and a Cockney accent. He had been lucky
               enough to keep a little shop in an independent borough, at the time of a violent
               contested election; and having adroitly kept back his vote till votes rose to their
               full value (I hope this is no breach of privilege), and then voted on the stronger
               side, he was at the time of which I speak comfortably settled in the excise as a
               tide-waiter, had a pretty neat house, brought up his family in good repute, wore a
               flaming red waistcoat, attended a dissenting meeting, and owed no man a shilling.</p>
            <p>These good people were very fond of their aunt, who had indeed, before they were so
               well off, shown them innumerable kindnesses. Perhaps there might be in the case a
               little gratitude for favours to come; for she had three or four hundred pounds to
               bequeath, partly her own savings, and partly a legacy from a distant relative; and
               they were her natural heirs. However that might be, they paid her all possible
               attention, and when we were about to return into the<pb n="240"/> country, petitioned
               so vehemently for a few weeks more, that, yielding to the above-mentioned infirmity,
               she consented to stay. I had myself been the ambassadress to Barbican to fetch our
               dear old friend; and I remember, as if it were yesterday, how earnestly I entreated
               her to come with me, and how seriously I lectured Mrs. Beck for her selfishness, in
               wishing to keep her aunt in London during the heat of June. I even, after taking
               leave, sprang out of the carriage, and ran again up stairs to persuade her to come
               with me. Mossy’s wishes were evidently on my side; but she had promised, and the
               performance of her promise was peremptorily claimed: so with a heavy heart I left
               her. I never saw her again. There is surely such a thing as presentiment. A violent
               attack of gout in the stomach carried her off in a few hours. Hail to thy memory! for
               thou wast of the antique world, when “service sweat for duty, not for meed!”</p>
