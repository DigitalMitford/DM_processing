            <head>A PARTING GLANCE AT OUR
               VILLAGE.<!--ebb: If there’s a subtitle use an <lb/> element to separate -->
            </head>
            <p>It is now eighteen months since our village first sat for its picture, and I cannot
               say farewell to my courteous readers, without giving them some little intelligence of
               our goings on, a sort of parting glance at us and our condition. In outward
               appearance it hath, I suppose, undergone less alteration than any place of its inches
               in the kingdom. There it stands, the same long straggling street of pretty cottages,
               divided by pretty gardens, wholly unchanged in size or appearance, unincreased and
               undiminished by a single brick. To be sure, yesterday evening a slight misfortune
               happened to our goodly tenement, occasioned by the unlucky diligence mentioned in my
               first notice, which, under the conduct of a sleepy coachman, and a restive horse,
               contrived to knock down and demolish the wall of our court, and fairly to drive
               through the front garden, thereby destroying sundry curious stocks, carnations, and
               geraniums. It is a mercy that the unruly steed<pb n="274"/> was content with
               battering the wall; for the messuage itself would come about our ears at the touch of
               a finger, and really there is one little end-parlour, an after-thought of the
               original builder, which stands so temptingly in the way, that I wonder the sagacious
               quadruped missed it. There was quite din enough without that addition. The three
               insides (ladies) squalling from the interior of that commodious vehicle; the outsides
               (gentlemen) swearing on the roof; the coachman, still half asleep, but unconsciously
               blowing his horn; we in the house screaming and scolding; the passers-by shouting and
               hallooing; and May, who little brooked such an invasion of her territories, barking
               in her tremendous lion-note, and putting down the other noises like a clap of
               thunder. But passengers, coachman, horses, and spectators, all righted at last; and
               there is no harm done but to my flowers and to the wall. May, however, stands
               bewailing the ruins, for that low wall was her favourite haunt; she used to parade
               backwards and forwards on the top of it, as if to show herself, just after the manner
               of a peacock on the top of a house; and would sit or lie for hours on the corner next
               the gate, basking in the sunshine like a marble statue. Really she has quite the air
               of one who laments the destruction of personal property; but the wall is to be
               rebuilt to-morrow, with old weather-stained bricks—no patch-work! and<pb n="275"/>
               exactly in the same form; May herself will not find the difference; so that in the
               way of alteration this little misfortune will pass for nothing. Neither have we any
               improvements worth calling such. Except that the wheeler’s green door hath been
               retouched, out of the same pot (as I judge from the tint) with which he furbished up
               our new-old pony-chaise; that the shop-window of our neighbour, the universal dealer,
               hath been beautified, and his name and calling splendidly set forth in yellow letters
               on a black ground; and that our landlord of the Rose hath hoisted a new sign of
               unparalleled splendour; one side consisting of a full-faced damask rose, of the size
               and hue of a piony, the other of a maiden blush in profile, which looks exactly like
               a carnation, so that both flowers are considerably indebted to the modesty of the
               “out-of-door artist,” who has warily written The Rose under each;—except these
               trifling ornaments, which nothing but the jealous eye of a lover could detect, the
               dear place is altogether unchanged.</p>
            <p>The only real improvement with which we have been visited for our sins—(I hate all
               innovation, whether for better or worse, as if I was a furious Tory, or a woman of
               three-score and ten)—the only misfortune of that sort which has befallen us, is under
               foot. The road has been adjusted on the plan of Mr. Mac-Adam; and a tremendous
               operation it is. I do<pb n="276"/> not know what good may ensue; but for the last six
               months, some part or other of the highway has been impassable for any feet, except
               such as are shod by the blacksmith; and even the four-footed people who wear iron
               shoes, make wry faces, poor things! at those stones, enemies to man and beast.
               However, the business is nearly done now; we are covered with sharp flints every inch
               of us, except a “bad step” up the hill, which, indeed, looks like a bit cut out of
               the deserts of Arabia, fitter for camels and caravans than for Christian horses and
               coaches; a point which in spite of my dislike of alteration I was forced to
               acknowledge to our surveyor, a portly gentleman, who, in a smart gig drawn by a
               prancing steed, was kicking up a prodigious dust at that very moment. He and I ought
               to be great enemies; for, besides the Mac-Adamite enormity of the stony road, he hath
               actually been guilty of tree-murder, having been an accessory before the fact in the
               death of three limes along the rope-walk—dear sweet innocent limes, that did no harm
               on earth except shading the path! I never should have for- given that offence, had
               not their removal, by opening a beautiful view from the village up the hill,
               reconciled even my tree-loving eye to their abstraction. And, to say the truth,
               though we have had twenty little squabbles there is no bearing malice with our
               surveyor; he is so civil and good-humoured, has such a bustling and happy
               self-importance, such<pb n="277"/> an honest earnestness in his vocation (which is
               gratuitous by the bye), and such an intense conviction that the state of the
               turnpike-road between B. and K., is the principal affair of this life, that I would
               not undeceive him for more worlds than one ever has to give. How often have I seen
               him on a cold winter morning, with a face all frost and business, great-coated up to
               the eyes, driving from post to post, from one gang of labourers to another, praising,
               scolding, ordering, cheated, laughed at, and liked by them all! Well, when once the
               hill is finished, we shall have done with him for ever, as he used to tell me by way
               of consolation, when I shook my head at him, as he went jolting along over his dear
               new roads, at the imminent risk of his springs and his bones; we shall see no more of
               him; for the Mac-Adam ways are warranted not to wear out. So be it; I never wish to
               see a roadmender again.</p>
            <p>But if the form of outward things be all unchanged around us, if the dwellings of man
               remain the same to the sight and the touch, the little world within hath undergone
               its usual mutations;—the hive is the same, but of the bees some are dead and some are
               flown away, and some that we left babes and sucklings, insects in the shell, are
               already putting forth their young wings. Children in our village really sprout up
               like mushrooms; the air is so promotive of growth, that<pb n="278"/> the rogues
               spring into men and women, as if touched by Harlequin’s wand, and are quite offended
               if one happens to say or do any thing which has a reference to their previous
               condition. My father grievously affronted Sally L., only yesterday, by bestowing upon
               her a great lump of gingerbread, with which he had stuffed his pockets at a fair. She
               immediately, as she said, gave it to “the children.” Now Sally cannot be above twelve
               to my certain knowledge, though taller than I am. Lizzy herself is growing womanly. I
               actually caught that little lady stuck on a chest of drawers, contemplating herself
               in the glass, and striving with all her might to gather the rich curls that hang
               about her neck, and turn them under a comb. Well! If Sally and Lizzy live to be old
               maids, they may probably make the amende honorable to time, and wish to be thought
               young again. In the meanwhile, shall we walk up the street?</p>
            <p>The first cottage is that of Mr. H. the patriot, the illuminator, the independent and
               sturdy yet friendly member of our little state, who, stout and comely, with a
               handsome chaise-cart, a strong mare, and a neat garden, might have passed for a
               portrait of that enviable class of Englishmen, who, after a youth of frugal industry,
               sit down in some retired place to “live upon their means.” He and his wife seemed the
               happiest couple on earth; except a little too mnch<pb n="279"/> leisure, I never
               suspected that they had one trouble or one care. But Care, the witch, will come
               everywhere, even to that happiest station, and this prettiest place. She came in one
               of her most terrific forms—blindness—or (which is perhaps still more tremendous) the
               faint glimmering light and gradual darkness which precede the total eclipse. For a
               long time we had missed the pleasant bustling officiousness, the little services, the
               voluntary tasks, which our good neighbour loved so well. Fruit trees were blighted,
               and escaped his grand specific, fumigation; wasps multiplied, and their nests
               remained untraced; theicheerful modest knock with which, just at the very hour when
               he knew it could be spared, he presented himself to ask for the newspaper, was heard
               no more; he no longer hung over his gate to way-lay passengers, and entice them into
               chat; at last he even left off driving his little chaise, and was only seen moping up
               and down the garden-walk, or stealing gropingly from the wood-pile to the house. He
               evidently shunned conversation or questions, forbade his wife to tell what ailed him,
               and even when he put a green shade over his darkened eyes, fled from human sympathy
               with a stern pride that seemed almost ashamed of the humbling infirmity. That strange
               (but to a vigorous and healthy man perhaps natural) feeling soon softened. The
               disease increased hourly, and he became depen<pb n="280"/>dent on his excellent wife
               for every comfort and relief. She had many willing assistants in her labour of love;
               all his neighbours strove to return, according to their several means, the kindness
               which all had received from him in some shape or other. The country boys, to whose
               service he had devoted so much time, in shaping bats, constructing bows and arrows,
               and other quips and trickeries of the same nature, vied with each other in performing
               little offices about the yard and stable; and John Evans, the half-witted gardener,
               to whom he had been a constant friend, repaid his goodness by the most unwearied
               attention. Gratitude even seemed to sharpen poor John’s perception and faculties.
               There is an old man in our parish work-house, who occasionally walks through the
               street, led by a little boy holding the end of a long stick. The idea of this man,
               who had lived in utter blindness for thirty years, was always singularly distressing
               to Mr. H. I shall never forget the address with which our simple gardener usedto try
               to divert his attention from this miserable fellow-sufferer. He would get between
               them to prevent the possibility of recognition by the dim and uncertain vision; would
               talk loudly to drown the peculiar noise, the sort of duet of feet, caused by the
               quick short steps of the child, and the slow irregular tread of the old man; and, if
               any one ventured to allude to<pb n="281"/> blind Robert, he would turn the
               conversation with an adroitness and acuteness which might put to shame the proudest
               intellect. So passed many months. At last Mr. H. was persuaded to consult a
               celebrated oculist, and the result was most comforting. The disease was ascertained
               to be a cataract; and now with the increase of darkness came an increase of hope. The
               film spread, thickened, ripened, speedily and healthily; and to-day the requisite
               operation has been performed with equal skill and success. You may still see some of
               the country boys lingering round the gate with looks of strong and wondering
               interest; poor John is going to and fro, he knows not for what, unable to rest a
               moment; Mrs. H., too, is walking in the garden, shedding tears of thankfulness; and
               he who came to support their spirit, the stout strong-hearted farmer A., seems
               trembling and overcome. The most tranquil person in the house is probably the
               patient: he bore the operation with resolute firmness, and he has seen again. Think
               of the bliss bound up in those four words! He is in darkness now, and must remain so
               for some weeks; but he has seen, and he will see; and that humble cottage is again a
               happy dwelling.</p>
            <p>Next we come to the shoemaker’s abode. All is unchanged there, except that its master
               becomes more industrious and more pale-faced, and that his fair<pb n="282"/> daughter
               is a notable exemplification of the developement which I have already noticed amongst
               our young things. But she is in the real transition state, just emerging from the
               chrysalis, and the eighteen months, between fourteen and a half and sixteen, would
               meta- morphose a child into a woman all the world over. She is still pretty, but not
               so elegant as when she wore frocks and pinafores, and, unconsciously classical,
               parted her long brown locks in the middle of her forehead, and twisted them up in a
               knot behind, giving to her finely-shaped head and throat the air of a Grecian statue.
               Then she was stirring all day in her small housewifery, or her busy idleness, delving
               and digging in her flower-border, tossing and dandling every infant that came within
               her reach, feeding pigs and poultry, playing with May, and prattling with an
               open-hearted frankness to the country lads, who assemble at evening in the shop to
               enjoy a little gentle gossiping; for be it known to my London readers, that the
               shoemaker’s in a country village is now what (according to tradition, and the old
               novels) the barber’s used to be, the resort of all the male newsmongers, especially
               the young. Then she talked to these visitors gaily and openly, sang and laughed and
               ran in and out, and took no more thought of a young man than of a gosling. Then she
               was only fourteen. Now she wears gowns and aprons,—puts her hair in paper,<pb n="283"
               />—has left off singing, talks,—has left off running, walks,—nurses the infants with
               a grave solemn grace,—has entirely cut her former playmate Mayflower, who tosses her
               pretty head as much as to say—who cares?—and has nearly renounced all acquaintance
               with the visitors of the shop, who are by no means disposed to take matters so
               quietly. There she stands on the threshold, shy and demure, just vouchsafing a formal
               nod or a faint smile as they pass, and, if she in her turn be compelled to pass the
               open door of their news-room (for the working apartment is separate from the house),
               edging along as slyly and mincingly as if there were no such beings as young men in
               the world. Exquisite coquette! I think (she is my opposite neighbour, and I have a
               right to watch her doings,—the right of retaliation), there is one youth particularly
               distinguished by her non-notice, one whom she never will see or speak to, who stands
               a very fair chance to carry her off. He is called Jem Tanner, and is a fine lad, with
               an open ruddy countenance, a clear blue eye, and curling hair of that tint which the
               poets are pleased to denominate golden. Though not one of our eleven, he was a
               promising cricketer. We have missed him lately on the green at the Sunday-evening
               game, and I find on enquiry that he now frequents a chapel about a mile off, where he
               is the best male singer, as our nymph of the shoe-shop is incom<pb n="284"/>parably
               the first female. I am not fond of betting; but I would venture the lowest stake of
               gentility, a silver three-pence, that, before the winter ends, a wedding will be the
               result of these weekly meetings at the chapel. In the long dark evenings, when the
               father has enough to do in piloting the mother with conjugal gallantry through the
               dirty lanes, think of the opportunity that Jem will have to escort the daughter. A
               little difficulty he may have to encounter: the lass will be coy for a while; the
               mother will talk of their youth, the father of their finances; but the marriage, I
               doubt not, will ensue.</p>
            <p>Next in order, on the other side of the street, is the blacksmith’s house. Change has
               been busy here in a different and more awful form. Our sometime constable, the
               tipsiest of parish officers, of blacksmiths and of men, is dead. Returning from a
               revel with a companion as full of beer as himself, one or the other, or both,
               contrived to overset the cart in a ditch; (the living scapegrace is pleased to lay
               the blame of the mishap on the horse, but that is contrary to all probability, this
               respectable quadruped being a water-drinker ;) and inward bruises, acting on inflamed
               blood and an impaired constitution, carried him off in a very short time, leaving an
               ailing wife and eight children, the eldest of whom is only fourteen years of age.
               This sounds like a very tragical story: yet, perhaps, be<pb n="285"/>cause the loss
               of a drunken husband is not quite so great a calamity as the loss of a sober one, the
               effect of this event is not altogether so melancholy as might be expected. The widow,
               when she was a wife, had a complaining broken-spirited air, a peevish manner, a
               whining voice, a dismal countenance, and a person so neglected and slovenly, that it
               was difficult to believe that she had once been remarkably handsome. She is now quite
               another woman. The very first Sunday she put on her weeds, we all observed how tidy
               and comfortable she looked, how much her countenance, in spite of a decent show of
               tears, was improved, and how completely through all her sighings her tone had lost
               its peevishness. I have never seen her out of spirits or out of humour since. She
               talks and laughs and bustles about, managing her journeymen and scolding her children
               as notably as any dame in the parish. The very house looks more cheerful; she has cut
               down the old willow-trees that stood in the court, and let in the light; and now the
               sun glances brightly from the casement windows, and plays amidst the vine-leaves and
               the clusters of grapes which cover the walls; the door is newly painted, and shines
               like the face of its mistress; even the forge has lost half its dinginess. Every
               thing smiles. She indeed talks by fits of “poor George,” especially when any allusion
               to her old enemy mine host of the Rose brings the deceased to her me<pb n="286"
               />mory; then she bewails (as is proper) her dear husband and her desolate condition;
               calls herself a lone widow; sighs over her eight children; complains of the troubles
               of business, and tries to persuade herself and others that she is as wretched as a
               good wife ought to be. But this will not do. She is a happier woman than she has been
               any time these fifteen years, and she knows it. My dear village-husbands, if you have
               a mind that your wives should be really sorry when you die, whether by a fall from a
               cart or otherwise, keep from the alehouse!</p>
            <p>Next comes the tall thin red house, that ought to boast genteeler inmates than its
               short fat mistress, its children, its pigs, and its quantity of noise, happiness, and
               vulgarity. The din is greater than ever. The husband, a merry jolly tar, with a voice
               that sounds as if issuing from a speaking trumpet, is returned from a voyage to
               India; and another little one, a chubby roaring boy, has added his lusty cries to the
               family concert.</p>
            <p>This door, blockaded by huge bales of goods, and half darkened by that moving
               mountain, the tilted waggon of the S. mill which stands before it, belongs to the
               village shop. Increase has been here too in every shape. Within fourteen months two
               little pretty quiet girls have come into the world. Before Fanny could well manage to
               totter across the road to her good<pb n="287"/> friend the nymph of the shoe-shop,
               Margaret made her appearance; and poor Fanny, discarded at once from the maid’s arms
               and her mother’s knee, degraded from the rank and privileges of “the baby,” (for at
               that age precedence is strangely reversed,) would have had a premature foretaste of
               the instability of human felicity, had she not taken refuge with that best of nurses,
               a fond father. Every thing thrives about the shop, from the rosy children to the neat
               maid and the smart apprentice. No room now for lodgers, and no need! The young
               mantua-making schoolmistresses, the old inmates, are gone; one of them not very far.
               She grew tired of scolding little boys and girls about their A, B, C, and of being
               scolded in her turn by their sisters and mothers about pelisses and gowns; so she
               gave up both trades almost a year ago, and has been ever since our pretty Harriet. I
               do not think she has ever repented of the exchange, though it might not perhaps have
               been made so soon, had not her elder sister, who had been long engaged to an
               attendant at one of the colleges of Oxford, thought herself on the point of marriage
               just as our housemaid left us. Poor Betsy! She had shared the fate of many a prouder
               maiden, wearing out her youth in expectation of the promotion that was to authorise
               her union with the man of her heart. Many a year had she waited in smiling constancy,
               fond of William in no common measure, and proud of him, as<pb n="288"/> well she
               might be; for, when the vacation so far lessened his duties as to render a short
               absence practicable, and he stole up here for a few days to enjoy her company, it was
               difficult to distinguish him in air and manner, as he sauntered about in elegant
               indolence with his fishing-rod and his flute, from the young Oxonians his masters. At
               last promotion came; and Betsy, apprised of it by an affectionate and congratulatory
               letter from his sister, prepared her wedding-clothes, and looked hourly for the
               bridegroom. No bridegroom came. A second letter announced, with regret and
               indignation, that William had made another choice, and was to be married early in the
               ensuing month. Poor Betsy! We were alarmed for her health, almost for her life. She
               wept incessantly, took no food, wandered recklessly about from morning till night,
               lost her natural rest, her flesh, her colour; and in less than a week she was so
               altered, that no one would have known her. Consolation and remonstrance were alike
               rejected, till at last Harriet happened to strike the right chord by telling her that
               “she wondered at her want of spirit.” This was touching her on the point of honour;
               she had always been remarkably high-spirited, and could as little brook the
               imputation as a soldier or a gentleman. This lucky suggestion gave an immediate turn
               to her feelings; anger and scorn succeeded to grief; she wiped her eyes, “hemmed away
               a sigh,”<pb n="289"/> and began to scold most manfully. She did still better. She
               recalled an old admirer, who in spite of repeated rejections had remained constant in
               his attachment, and made such good speed, that she was actually married the day
               before her faithless lover, and is now the happy wife of a very respectable
               tradesman.</p>
            <p>Ah! the in-and-out cottage! the dear, dear home! No weddings there! No changes!
               except that the white kitten, who sits purring at the window under the great myrtle,
               has succeeded to his lamented grandfather, our beautiful Persian cat, I cannot find
               one alteration to talk about. The wall of the court indeed—but that will be mended
               to-morrow.</p>
            <p>Here is the new sign, the well-frequented Rose inn! Plenty of changes there! Our
               landlord is always improving, if it be only a pig-sty or a watering-trough—plenty of
               changes and one splendid wedding. Miss Phoebe is married, not to her old lover the
               recruiting sergeant (for he had one wife already, probably more,) but to a
               patten-maker, as errant a dandy as ever wore mustachios. How Phoebe could “abase her
               eyes” from the stately sergeant to this youth, half a foot shorter than herself,
               whose “waist would go into any alder-man’s thumb-ring,” might, if the final choice of
               a coquette had ever been matter of wonder, have occasioned some speculation. But our
               patten-maker is a man of spirit; and the wedding was of extraordinary splen<pb
                  n="290"/>dour. Three gigs, each containing four persons, graced the procession,
               beside numerous carts and innumerable pedestrians. The bride was equipped in muslin
               and satin, and really looked very pretty with her black sparkling eyes, her clear
               brown complexion, her blushes and her smiles; the bride-maidens were only less smart
               than the bride; and the bridegroom was “point device in his accoutrements,” and as
               munificent as a nabob. Cake flew about the village; plum-puddings were abundant; and
               strong beer, aye, even mine host’s best double X, was profusely distributed. There
               was all manner of eating and drinking, with singing, fiddling, and dancing between;
               and in the evening, to crown all, there was Mr. Moon the conjuror. Think of that
               stroke of good fortune !—Mr. Moon, the very pearl of all conjurors, who had the
               honour of puzzling and delighting their late Majesties with his “wonderful and
               pleasing exhibition of Thaumaturgics, Tachygraphy, mathematical operations, and
               magical deceptions,” happened to arrive about an hour before dinner, and commenced
               his ingenious deceptions very unintentionally at our house. Calling to apply for
               permission to perform in the village, being equipped in a gay scarlet coat, and
               having something smart and sportsman-like in his appearance, he was announced by
               Harriet as one of the gentlemen of the C. Hunt, and taken (mistaken I should have
               said) by the whole family for a certain captain<pb n="291"/> newly arrived in the
               neighbourhood. That misunderstanding, which must, I think, have retaliated on Mr.
               Moon a little of the puzzlement that he inflicts on others, vanished of course at the
               production of his bill of fare; and the requested permission was instantly given.
               Never could he have arrived in a happier hour! Never were spectators more gratified
               or more scared. All the tricks prospered. The cock crew after his head was cut off;
               and half-crowns and sovereigns flew about as if winged; the very wedding-ring could
               not escape Mr. Moon’s incantations. We heard of nothing else for a week. From the
               bridegroom, un esprit fort, who defied all manner of conjuration and diablerie, down
               to my Lizzy, whose boundless faith swallows the Arabian Tales, all believed and
               trembled. So thoroughly were men, women, and children, impressed with the idea of the
               worthy conjuror’s dealings with the devil, that when he had occasion to go to B., not
               a soul would give him a cast, from pure awe; and if it had not been for our
               pony-chaise, poor Mr. Moon must have walked. I hope he is really a prophet; for he
               foretold all happiness to the new-married pair.</p>
            <p>So this pretty white house with the lime-trees before it, which has been under repair
               for these three years, is on the point of being finished. The vicar has taken it, as
               the vicarage-house is not yet fit for his reception. He has sent before him a neat
               modest maid-servant,<pb n="292"/> whose respectable appearance gives a character to
               her master and mistress,—a hamper full of flower-roots, sundry boxes of books, a
               piano-forte, and some simple and useful furniture. Well, we shall certainly have
               neighbours, and I have a presentiment that we shall find friends.</p>
            <p>Lizzy, you may now come along with me round the corner and up the lane, just to the
               end of the wheeler’s shop, and then we shall go home; it is high time. What is this
               affiche in the parlour window ? “Apartments to let—inquire within.” These are
               certainly the curate’s lodgings—is he going away? Oh I suppose the new vicar will do
               his own duty—yet, however well he may do it, rich and poor will regret the departure
               of Mr. B. Well, I hope that he may soon get a good living. “Lodgings to let”—who ever
               thought of seeing such a placard hereabout? The lodgings, indeed, are very convenient
               for a single gentleman, “a man and his wife, or two sisters,” as the newspapers
               say—comfortable apartments, neat and tasty withal, with the addition of very civil
               treatment from the host and hostess. Lodgings to let in our village!</p>
