                           <p>Two folio sheets of <material>paper</material>, folded in half, with correspondence on recto and verso 1-4; one folio sheet
                              of <material>paper</material> with correspondence on recto and verso 5-6. There is a gap on page
                              6 intended for an address. The pages are
                              folded in half and thirds twice more and were sealed for posting. It appears that pages 1-4 are two large sheets folded
                           in half; the last page (5-6) is one sheet. This letter is glued into a scrapbook. </p>
                           <p>Address leaf (back of page 5) bears a black circular
                              wax stamp; there is a mileage stamp <!--Applied upon deposit of letter at local PO--> reading<stamp>READING<lb/>

                           bottom. This page is also wrinkled - possibly due to the seal.</p>

           <p>Mitford's spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the
              end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford's
              spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate
              searching we are using the TEI elements "choice," "sic," and "reg" to encode both
              Mitford's spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling,
              following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and
              ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>
