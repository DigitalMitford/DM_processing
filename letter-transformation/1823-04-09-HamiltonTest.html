            <span id="Note1" class="anchor">[1] <span class="note" id="n1">Our text is based on the published text of 1834.
                   Variants are
                  recorded from the manuscript held in the British Library, originally submitted in
                  1825 to the Examiner's office.—</span></span>
            <span id="Note2" class="anchor">[2] <span class="note" id="n2">The hand in the manuscript is Mary Russell Mitford's. Mitford tends to write out
                  the full character names, whereas published versions abbreviate. For this variant
                  edition, we are not recording distinctions in delineating the speaker names in the
                  manuscript vs. published version when the speakers are identical.—</span></span>
            
            
            
            
            <p>Repository: British Library. Shelf mark: Add MS 42873, folio pages 402-404 and 415-499</p>
            
            Paper, quarto-sized sheets.
            Written on the front sides of the sheets.
            
            
            
            <p>Hands other than Mitford's noted on this manuscript: </p>
            <ul>
               <li>In the manuscript of 1825, Mitford's hand numbers the pages of the play in
                  sequence from 1 to 85. A second hand in pencil has renumbered the folio pages for
                  inclusion in this volume of Plays from the Lord Chamberlain's Office, from 415 to
                  499.
               </li>
            </ul>
            
            Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the
            end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling
            and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching
            we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s
            spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following
            the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured
            forms are not encoded.
