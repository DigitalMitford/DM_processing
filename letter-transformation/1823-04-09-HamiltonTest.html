                        sketches, Mary Russell Mitford is, of course,
                        the subject of our archive. Mary Russell
                        Mitford was born on December 16,
                        1787 at New Alresford, Hampshire, the only
                        child of George Mitford (or Midford)
                        and Mary Russell. She was baptized on
                        February 29, 1788. Much of her writing was
                        devoted to supporting herself and her
                        parents. She received a civil list pension in 1837. Census records from 1841 indicate
                        that she is living with her
                        father George, three female servants:
                        Kerenhappuch Taylor (Mary’s ladies
                        maid), two maids of all work, Mary Bramley and Mary Allaway, and a manservant
                        (probably serving also as gardener), Benjamin Embury. The 1851 census lists her
                        occupation as "authoress," and lists her as living at Three Mile Cross with Kerenhappuch
                        Taylor (lady’s maid), Sarah Chernk
                        (maid-of-all-work), and Samuel Swetman (gardener), after the death of her
                        father. Mitford’s long life and prolific career ended after injuries from a
                        carriage accident. She died on 10 January 1855
                        at Swallowfield, Berkshire
                        and she is buried in Swallowfield churchyard. The executor of her will and her
                        literary executor was the Rev. William
                        Harness and her lady’s maid, Kerenhappuch Taylor Sweetman, was residuary legatee of
                        her
                        estate.

                        A lifelong friend of Mary Russell Mitford
                        who knew her from their childhood in the 1790s, Harness launched the first
                        major effort to collect and edit Mitford’s letters into a series of volumes,
                        which was completed by his assistant, Alfred Guy
                        Kingan L’Estrange a year after Harness’s death, and published
                        as The Life of Mary Russell Mitford, Related
                        in a Selection from her Letters to her Friends. This collection
                        was originally intended to be six volumes, but was cut back to three by the
                        publishers, to Harness’s distress.
                        Harness and Byron were also friends from
                        their schooling at Harrow, as Byron sympathized with Harness’s experience of
                        a disabled foot, crushed in an accident in early childhood. Byron considered
                        dedicating the first two cantos of Childe Harold’s
                        Pilgrimage
                        to Harness, but refrained so as not to taint Harness’s reputation as
                        he was taking orders as an Anglican curate. Harness admired and encouraged
                        Mitford’s playwrighting in particular, and she commented that he was one of
                        the few of her friends who thought she should prioritize the drama over
                        prose. When William Macready was
                        attacked in an anonymous Blackwood’s Magazine piece
                        in 1825 for his demands and rudeness to Mitford over revisions to
                        Rienzi, Macready assumed that Harness was
                        the author of the anonymous piece, though in 1839
                        after many years of distance, Harness assured Macready in person that he was
                        not the writer, though he may have shared word of the poor treatment his
                        friend had endured.
                        William Harness was born on March 14, 1790 in Wickham, Berkshire to John
                        Harness, M.D. and Sarah Dredge; he was baptized at Whitchurch, Hampshire on
                        April 13, 1790. He received his B.A. in 1812 and his M.A. in 1816 from
                        Christ’s College, Cambridge. He served as curate at Kelmeston, Hampshire
                        (1812) and Dorking (1814-1816). He was preacher at Trinity Chapel, Conduit
                        Stree, London and minister and lecturer at St. Anne’s in Soho. He was Boyle
                        lecturer in London (1822) and was curate at Hampstead from 1828 to 1844. In
                        1825, he published an eight-volume edition of Shakespeare, including a
                        biography; his friends would later endow a prize in his name at Cambridge
                        for the study of Shakespearean literature. He also authored numerous essays
                        and reviews, some for the Quarterly Review. From 1844 to 1847 he was
                        minister of Brompton Chapel in London. He undertook to raise the funds to
                        build the church of All Saints, Knightsbridge, in the parish of St.
                        Margaret’s Westminster, which opened in 1849, and became perpetual curate of
                        that congregation. At the 1851 and 1861 censuses, he lived at 3 Hyde Park
                        Terrace, Westminster St. Margaret, Middlesex, with his sister Mary Harness
                        and his first cousin Jemima Harness, daughter of his uncle William. He died
                        on November 11, 1869 while on a visit to one of his former curates in
                        Battle, Sussex. At the time of his death he living at the same address at 3
                        Hyde Park Terrace; he is buried in Bath. [Sources:

                           Close friend, literary mentor, and frequent correspondent of Mary Russell Mitford.
                           Thomas Noon Talfourd was born
                           on May 26, 1795 at Reading, Berkshire and baptised on July 12, 1795 at the Broad Street
                           Chapel in Reading, the eldest child of Rev. Edward
                           Talfourd and Anne Isabella Noon. His
                           father was a brewer and later established a lunatic asylum for female
                           patients at Normand House, Fulham, which he ran until
                           his death, and the supervision of which was later conducted by his wife and
                           his daughter Anne.
                           
                           Thomas Noon Talfourd married Rachel Rutt on August 31,
                           1822 at St. John, Hackney, Middlesex. Rachel was the
                           daughter of radical politician and writer John
                           Towill Rutt. Thomas and Rachel had five children: Francis,
                           Mary, Katharine, Thomas Noon [II], and William Wordsworth. In 1832, the family lived
                           at 26 Henrietta
                           Street, St Andrew, Holborn and St George the Martyr, Bloomsbury,
                           England. In 1837, they lived at
                           56 Russell Square, St. George, Bloomsbury.
                           Talfourd’s chambers were at 2 Elm Court, Temple,
                           London.
                           Talfourd was educated at the newly-established Mill Hill school, a
                           dissenting academy in Reading, from 1808 to 1810. He attended Dr. Richard Valpy’s
                           Reading School from 1810 to 1812. He
                           completed a legal apprenticeship with Joseph Christy, special pleader, in
                           1817, and was called to the bar in London in 1821. He ultimately earned a
                           D.C.L. (Doctor of Civil Laws) from Oxford on June 20, 1844. While
                           establishing his practice as a barrister and special pleader, he worked as
                           legal correspondent for The
                           Times, reporting on the Oxford
                           Circuit, and also continued his literary interests. After 1833,
                           he was appointed Serjeant at Law, as well as a King’s and Queen’s Counsel.
                           He was elected and served as Member of Parliament for
                           Reading
                           from 1835 to 1841 and from 1847 to 1849
                           ; he served with Charles Fyshe
                           Palmer, Charles Russell, and
                           Francis Piggott. Highlights of his political and
                           legal career included introducing the first copyright bill
                           into Parliament in 1837 (for which action Charles
                           Dickens dedicated Pickwick Papers
                           to him) and defending Edward
                           Moxon’s publication of Percy Shelley’s
                           Queen Mab in 1841
                           . He was appointed Queen’s Serjeant in 1846
                           and Judge of Common Pleas in 1849
                           , at which post he served until his death in 1854. He
                           was knighted in 1850
                           .
                           Talfourd’s literary works include his plays 
                           Ion (1835), 
                           The Athenian Captive (1837) and 
                           Glencoe, or the Fate of the

                           George Mitford was born on November 15, 1760 in Hexham,
                           Northumberland, the son of Francis
                           Midford, surgeon, and Jane Graham. He was
                           related to the Mitfords of Mitford Castle, Northumberland. In 1784, he was living
                           in Alresford and is listed in a
                           Hampshire directory as "surgeon (medicine)." Although later sources would
                           claim that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh medical school,
                           there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree; his father and
                           grandfather worked as surgeon-apothecaries and it seems likely that he
                           served a medical apprenticeship with family members. He married Mary Russell on October
                           17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                           Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their
                           addresses as Old Alresford; they later came to live
                           at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live to adulthood,
                           Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years
                           later on December 16, 1787 at New
                           Alresford, Hampshire. George
                           Mitford died on December 11,
                           1842 at Three Mile
                           Cross in the parish of Shinfield,

                           1787 at New Alresford, Hampshire, the only

                           and Mary Russell. She was baptized on
                           February 29, 1788. Much of her writing was
                           devoted to supporting herself and her
                           parents. She received a civil list pension in 1837. Census records from 1841 indicate
                           that she is living with her
                           father George, three female servants:
                           Kerenhappuch Taylor (Mary’s ladies
                           maid), two maids of all work, Mary Bramley and Mary Allaway, and a manservant
                           (probably serving also as gardener), Benjamin Embury. The 1851 census lists her
                           occupation as "authoress," and lists her as living at Three Mile Cross with Kerenhappuch
                           Taylor (lady’s maid), Sarah Chernk
                           (maid-of-all-work), and Samuel Swetman (gardener), after the death of her
                           father. Mitford’s long life and prolific career ended after injuries from a
                           carriage accident. She died on 10 January 1855

                           Thomas Noon Talfourd was born
                           on May 26, 1795 at Reading, Berkshire and baptised on July 12, 1795 at the Broad Street
                           Chapel in Reading, the eldest child of Rev. Edward
                           Talfourd and Anne Isabella Noon. His
                           father was a brewer and later established a lunatic asylum for female
                           patients at Normand House, Fulham, which he ran until
                           his death, and the supervision of which was later conducted by his wife and
                           his daughter Anne.
                           
                           Thomas Noon Talfourd married Rachel Rutt on August 31,
                           1822 at St. John, Hackney, Middlesex. Rachel was the
                           daughter of radical politician and writer John
                           Towill Rutt. Thomas and Rachel had five children: Francis,
                           Mary, Katharine, Thomas Noon [II], and William Wordsworth. In 1832, the family lived
                           at 26 Henrietta
                           Street, St Andrew, Holborn and St George the Martyr, Bloomsbury,
                           England. In 1837, they lived at
                           56 Russell Square, St. George, Bloomsbury.
                           Talfourd’s chambers were at 2 Elm Court, Temple,
                           London.
                           Talfourd was educated at the newly-established Mill Hill school, a
                           dissenting academy in Reading, from 1808 to 1810. He attended Dr. Richard Valpy’s
                           Reading School from 1810 to 1812. He
                           completed a legal apprenticeship with Joseph Christy, special pleader, in
                           1817, and was called to the bar in London in 1821. He ultimately earned a
                           D.C.L. (Doctor of Civil Laws) from Oxford on June 20, 1844. While
                           establishing his practice as a barrister and special pleader, he worked as
                           legal correspondent for The
                           Times, reporting on the Oxford
                           Circuit, and also continued his literary interests. After 1833,
                           he was appointed Serjeant at Law, as well as a King’s and Queen’s Counsel.
                           He was elected and served as Member of Parliament for
                           Reading
                           from 1835 to 1841 and from 1847 to 1849
                           ; he served with Charles Fyshe
                           Palmer, Charles Russell, and
                           Francis Piggott. Highlights of his political and
                           legal career included introducing the first copyright bill
                           into Parliament in 1837 (for which action Charles
                           Dickens dedicated Pickwick Papers
                           to him) and defending Edward

                           Queen Mab in 1841
                           . He was appointed Queen’s Serjeant in 1846
                           and Judge of Common Pleas in 1849
                           , at which post he served until his death in 1854. He
                           was knighted in 1850
                           .

                           borough of Westminster. One of the royal "patent theaters." The first theater
                           on this site was opened in 1732 by John Rich, renovated by architect Henry Holland
                           in 1792, and destroyed by fire on 20 Sept. 1808. The second theater,
                           designed by Robert Smirke, opened on 18 Sept. 1809 and was managed by John Phillip
                           Kemble. Because of rent increases
                           by the Duke of Bedford, the landowner, J.P. Kemble increased ticket prices.
                           This led to the "old price (or O.P.) riots" and the eventual lowering of ticket
                           prices, although the proprietors proved they would lose money at those prices.
                           The second theater was destroyed by fire on 5 March 1856. The third theater,
                           designed by Edward Middleton Barry, opened in 1858 and remains at the center of
                           today’s theater complex. The theater became the Royal Opera House in 1892 and
                           the building was renovated and expanded in the 1980s and 1990s. --#lmw51.5129211 -0.12219759999993585</span></span> is that <span class="context" title="person">Mr. Macready<span class="si">William Macready<br />

                           George Mitford was born on November 15, 1760 in Hexham,
                           Northumberland, the son of Francis
                           Midford, surgeon, and Jane Graham. He was
                           related to the Mitfords of Mitford Castle, Northumberland. In 1784, he was living
                           in Alresford and is listed in a
                           Hampshire directory as "surgeon (medicine)." Although later sources would
                           claim that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh medical school,
                           there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree; his father and
                           grandfather worked as surgeon-apothecaries and it seems likely that he
                           served a medical apprenticeship with family members. He married Mary Russell on October
                           17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                           Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their
                           addresses as Old Alresford; they later came to live
                           at Broad Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live to adulthood,
                           Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years
                           later on December 16, 1787 at New
                           Alresford, Hampshire. George
                           Mitford died on December 11,
                           1842 at Three Mile

                        the subject of our archive. Mary Russell
                        Mitford was born on December 16,
                        1787 at New Alresford, Hampshire, the only
                        child of George Mitford (or Midford)
                        and Mary Russell. She was baptized on
                        February 29, 1788. Much of her writing was
                        devoted to supporting herself and her
                        parents. She received a civil list pension in 1837. Census records from 1841 indicate
                        that she is living with her
                        father George, three female servants:
                        Kerenhappuch Taylor (Mary’s ladies
                        maid), two maids of all work, Mary Bramley and Mary Allaway, and a manservant
                        (probably serving also as gardener), Benjamin Embury. The 1851 census lists her
                        occupation as "authoress," and lists her as living at Three Mile Cross with Kerenhappuch
                        Taylor (lady’s maid), Sarah Chernk
                        (maid-of-all-work), and Samuel Swetman (gardener), after the death of her
                        father. Mitford’s long life and prolific career ended after injuries from a
                        carriage accident. She died on 10 January 1855
                        at Swallowfield, Berkshire
                        and she is buried in Swallowfield churchyard. The executor of her will and her
                        literary executor was the Rev. William
                        Harness and her lady’s maid, Kerenhappuch Taylor Sweetman, was residuary legatee of
                        her
                        estate.
