            One folio sheet of paper, with correspondence on recto and verso 1-4. This is a partial letter, as the correspondence
            at end of page 4 ends abruptly, and no address or postal markings appear. The pages
            are folded in half lengthwise, in half width-wise, and again in thirds for posting.
             
            No address, postmarks, or fees recorded.
             
            
            Slight fraying and darkening of page edges, along with some fading ink at page edges,
            and darkening of page 5.
            
            Seal absent. 
            
            
            
            <p>Hands other than Mitford's noted on this manuscript: </p>
            <ul>
               <li> Someone, apparently other than Mitford, perhaps cataloging letters and describing
                  them, who left grey pencil marks and numbered her letters now in the Reading Central
                  Library's collection. This letter is numbered <q>2</q> on the top center of the first leaf. Above the number and diagonally to its left,
                  in the left corner of the first leaf, is written <q>To TN Talfourd.</q> A line is drawn under these words, and the words <q>from Miss Mitford</q> appear.
                  </li>
            </ul>
            
            Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the
            end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling
            and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching
            we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s
            spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following
            the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured
            forms are not encoded.

                           Richard Valpy (the fourth of that name) was the eldest son of Richard Valpy
                           [III] and Catherine Chevalier. He was a friend and literary mentor to
                           <span class="context" title="person">Mary Russell Mitford</span>. He matriculated at
                           Pembroke College, Oxford University on April 1, 1773, aged eighteen, as a
                           Morley scholar. He received from Oxford a B.A. (1776), M.A. (1784), B.D.
                           &amp; D.D. (1792). He took orders in the Church of England in 1777. Richard
                           Valpy served as Second Master at Bury School, Bury, Huntindonshire from 1771
                           to 1781, and was also collated to the rectory of Stradishall, Suffolk, in
                           1787. He became the Headmaster at Reading School, Reading, Berkshire, in
                           1781 and served until 1830, at which time he turned the Headmastership over
                           to his youngest son Francis E. J. Valpy and continued in semi-retirement
                           until his death in 1836. During his tenure as Headmaster of <span class="context" title="place">Reading Grammar School</span> for boys over
                           the course of fifty years, he expanded the boarding school and added new
                           buildings. He is the author of numerous published works, including Greek and
                           Latin textbooks, sermons, volumes of poetry, and adaptations of plays such
                           as Shakespeare’s King John and Sheridan’s The Critic. His <span class="context" title="title">Elements of

                           used as school texts throughout the nineteenth century. Valpy’s students
                           performed his own adaptations of Greek, Latin, and English plays for the
                           triennial visitations and the play receipts went to charitable
                           organizations. Valpy enlisted Mitford to write reviews of the productions
                           for the <span class="context" title="title">Reading Mercury</span>. In 1803, his
                           adaptation of Shakespeare’s King John was performed at Covent Garden

                           Richard Valpy was married twice and had twelve children, eleven of whom

                           though the two magazines soon came into heated contention. This series ran
                           until 1829, and this is the series to which Mitford and her correspondents frequently

He was a member of a minor branch of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland.
                           Although later sources would suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh
                           medical school, there is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did
                           not generally refer to himself as <q>Dr. Mitford</q>, preferring to style himself <q>Esq.</q>.

                           The Dickinson family were Quakers who lived in the vicinity of Bristol, Gloucestershire.
                           On <span class="date" title="1807-08-03">August 3, 1807</span>, he married <span class="context" title="person">Catherine Allingham</span> at St Giles, South Mimms, Middlesex. They lived at Farley Hill, near Swallowfield,
                           Berkshire, where their daughter Frances was born, and where the Mitfords visited them.
                           Charles Dickinson owned a private press he employed to print literary works by his
                           friends (See letters to Elford from March 13, 1819 and June 21, 1820). He wrote and

                           Wars, Napoleon rose to prominence as a military leader. He engineered a coup in 1799
                           that brought him to power as First Consul of France and then as Napoleon I, Emperor
                           of the French (from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815). As Emperor, he led France
                           against a series of European military coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars, building
                           an empire that extended over most of continental Europe until its collapse in 1815.
                           In spring 1814, the Allies captured Paris and forced Napoleon to abdicate, exiling
                           him to the island of Elba and restoring the Bourbons to power. Less than a year later,
                           Napoleon escaped from Elba and retook control of France, only to suffer defeat by
                           the Allies at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. The British then exiled him to
                           the island Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, where he remained until his death in
                           1821. He is celebrated as one of Europe's greatest military commanders and as the
