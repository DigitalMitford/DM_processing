                     State University of New York at Potsdam
                     <br/>Lisa M. Wilson is Professor in the Department of English and Communication at SUNY
                     Potsdam, where she has taught since 2005. Her areas of interest include transatlantic
                     Romantic and Victorian era literature, particularly women’s  writing and popular forms
                     such as the Gothic novel and the literary ballad. She is also interested in book history
                     and bibliographical studies, particularly in the study of authorship in the long nineteenth
                     century (1780-1900). She has published in <span class="context" title="title">European Romantic Review</span>, <span class="context" title="title">Romanticism on the Net</span> (now <span class="context" title="title">RaVon</span>), <span class="context" title="title">Romantic Circles</span>, <span class="context" title="title">Romantic Textualities</span>, and elsewhere. She is currently working on a monograph on Romantic-period authorship
                     and literary celebrity. Her work on Digital Mitford thus far includes editing and
                     coding Mitford’s <span class="context" title="title">Introduction</span> to her collected <span class="context" title="title">Dramatic Works</span> (1854), a critical memoir that recounts the author’s influences and experiences at
                     Covent Garden and Drury Lane in the 1820s and 30s. It also includes researching Mitford’s
                     publication history for the site’s working bibliography, particularly tracking the
                     migration of Mitford’s stories from their first publication to their later reappearances
                     in collections and periodicals. A Founding Editor of Digital Mitford, she and her
                     teams of student research assistants have been at work since 2013 on transcribing,
                     coding, and researching Mitford’s letters from 1819 to the early 1820s and on Mitford’s
                     early poems.

            and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching
            we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s
            spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following
            the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured

                           Mitford likely refers to Primula vulgaris, a species of flowering plant in the
                           family Primulaceae, native to <span class="context" title="place">western and southern
                              Europe</span>, commonly called the English primrose or common primrose.
                           It is not to be confused with evening primrose or Oenothera, a genus of 100+
                           species of herbaceous flowering plants native to the Americas, which are not
                           closely related to the true primroses (genus Primula). Mitford also mentions
                           the evening primrose in her writing. Evening primroses have been cultivated in
                           Europe since the early seventeenth century and are now naturalized in some
                           parts of Europe and Asia. —lmw</span></span> was a sad reflection on all of us—the truth is that I had distracted my memory by telling <span class="context" title="person"><span class="si">Lucy Sweatser Hill | Born: 1790-05-02 in Stratfield Saye, Berkshire,
