            <h3>Letter to <span class="context" title="person">Sir William Elford<span class="si">William Elford, Sir, baronet
                     , Recorder for Plymouth, Recorder for Totnes, 
                     Member of Parliament for Plymouth
                     , 
                     Member of Parliament for Rye, 
                     Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), 
                     Fellow of the Linnaean Society (FLS) | Born: 1749-08 in Kingsbridge, Devon, England. Died: 1837-11-30 in Totnes, Devon, England. <br>
                     According to L'Estrange, Sir William was first a friend of
                     Mitford's father, and 
                     Mitford met him for the first time in the
                     spring of 1810 when he was a widower nearing the
                     age of 64. They carried on a lively correspondence until his death
                     in 1837.
                     Elford worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase)
                     in Plymouth, Devon, from its
                     founding in 1782. He was elected a member of
                     Parliament for Plymouth as a
                     supporter of the government and Tory William
                     Pitt, and served from 1796 to 1806. After his election defeat
                     in Plymouth in 1806, he was elected member of Parliament for Rye and served
                     from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service in
                     Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800. After his
                     son Jonathan came of age, he tried to
                     secure a stable government post for him but never succeeded. Mayor of
                     Plymouth in 1796 and Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833, he was also
                     Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer in
                     the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of
                     Lieutenant Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars.
                     Sir
                     William was a talented amateur painter in oils and watercolors
                     who exhibited at the Royal Society from 1774 to 1837; he
                     exhibited still lifes and portraits but preferred landscapes. He was elected
                     to the Royal Society Academy in 1790. He was also a
                     talented amateur naturalist and was elected to the Royal Linnaean
                     Society in 1790; late in life, he published his findings on an
                     alternative to yeast.
                     He
                     married his first wife, Mary Davies
                     of Plympton, on January 20, 1776 and they had
                     one son, Jonathan, and two daughters,
                     Grace Chard and Elizabeth. After the death of his
                     first wife, he married Elizabeth Hall
                     Walrond, widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Maine Swete
                     Walrond of the Coldstream Guards.
                     His
                     only son Jonathan died in 1823, leaving him without an heir.

            Two folio sheets of paper, folded in half, with correspondence on recto and verso 1-4; one folio sheet
            of paper with correspondence on recto and verso 5-6. There is a gap on page
            6 intended for an address. The pages are
            folded in half and thirds twice more and were sealed for posting. It appears that
            pages 1-4 are two large sheets folded
            in half; the last page (5-6) is one sheet. This letter is glued into a scrapbook.
            
            Address leaf (back of page 5) bears a black circular
            wax stamp; there is a mileage stamp  readingREADING<br>

            Address leaf is written in another hand.
            
            Page 5/6: has a piece torn away on the side of the page and a small hole is
            seen above the wax seal on page 6; there is a small tear on the
            bottom. This page is also wrinkled - possibly due to the seal.

            Mitford's spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the

            spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate
            searching we are using the TEI elements "choice," "sic," and "reg" to encode both
            Mitford's spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling,
            following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and
            ligatured forms are not encoded.

                        the Bath Road and was developing into a center of manufacturing. Mitford lived here

                        According to L'Estrange, Sir William was first a friend of
                        Mitford's father, and 
                        Mitford met him for the first time in the
                        spring of 1810 when he was a widower nearing the
                        age of 64. They carried on a lively correspondence until his death
                        in 1837.
                        Elford worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase)
                        in Plymouth, Devon, from its
                        founding in 1782. He was elected a member of

                        supporter of the government and Tory William
                        Pitt, and served from 1796 to 1806. After his election defeat
                        in Plymouth in 1806, he was elected member of Parliament for Rye and served
                        from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service in
                        Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800. After his
                        son Jonathan came of age, he tried to
                        secure a stable government post for him but never succeeded. Mayor of
                        Plymouth in 1796 and Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833, he was also
                        Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer in
                        the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of
                        Lieutenant Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars.
                        Sir
                        William was a talented amateur painter in oils and watercolors
                        who exhibited at the Royal Society from 1774 to 1837; he
                        exhibited still lifes and portraits but preferred landscapes. He was elected
                        to the Royal Society Academy in 1790. He was also a
                        talented amateur naturalist and was elected to the Royal Linnaean
                        Society in 1790; late in life, he published his findings on an
                        alternative to yeast.
                        He
                        married his first wife, Mary Davies
                        of Plympton, on January 20, 1776 and they had
                        one son, Jonathan, and two daughters,
                        Grace Chard and Elizabeth. After the death of his
