            <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the
               end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s
               spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate
               searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both
               Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling,
               following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and
               ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

            <p>Pray forgive the trouble that I am going to give you--Will you have the goodness to ascertain from Mr. Macready whether it is at all necessary that I should see him to hear from himself his suggestions respecting Rienzi. &amp; talk them over with him, or whether they are such as may be transmitted through you--If he wishes to see me will you have the goodness to appoint a morning the end of this week, or next week or whenever suits him that I may wait on him at Hampstead for that purpose-- &amp; just let me know by one line when to come up. Pray pray forgive this trouble--But you know I have good cause to fear Mr. Macready's leaving London without letting us know &amp; the time is drawing on.--Or if you think it necessary for any other of my literary affairs I can come up--I had rather not of course--but still my dear father is now so well recovered (though still very weak) that I can leave him without fear--&amp; as I should sleep at the decent Inn where the Coach puts up &amp; only stay one day there would be very little expence or inconvenience in the journey.</p>
