Welcome to the Sandbox in the Digital Mitford project's GitHub. 
This is designed to be a safe area for project collaborators to practice with committing and pushing files into our GitHub repository. 

* **Read and follow the instructions** here to get started with GitHub: http://dh.obdurodon.org/github.xhtml
* Try to "clone" our Mitford repository ([from the main webpage here](https://github.com/ebeshero/mitford/)) on your local computer 
* In order for you to push files and open issues here, I need to add you as a collaborator. Set up your own GitHub account and write to me to tell me how to find you.
* We recommend installing a free desktop client for convenient use of GitHub as a repository to manage shared class and project files: https://desktop.github.com/. The desktop client helps you with synchronizing local Github directories on your computer(s) with the central repository in the GitHub cloud.
* When you have set up an account and have a desktop client to work with, you are ready to experiment with pushing (or committing) new files to this repository. Save a file in your local folder (or the "clone" of this repository), and then use your GitHub client to "push" a file into this online collaboration space. To do this, first commit your changes and write the required commit message. Then you must sync in order to push these to the GitHub cloud.

* **Always be sure to "sync"** your local folder to receive any changes pushed to this GitHub repository. Always sync your local directory with our cloud directory here on the web **when you begin work**, and **when you conclude work** at a local computer.

* Now, there are things we'll do together **only in the webpage view of GitHub:** See if you can find the "Issues" and "Wiki" areas (mousing over the icons on the right-hand side of the GitHub page): "Issues" is the exclamation point inside the circle, and the "Wiki" pages will be under the icon for a book. We're using the "Issues" page to open conversations about questions, problems, things we need to discuss and fix and work on together. If we formulate a new method or policy we definitely want to follow, we'll post a Wiki page about it. The Issues and Wikis are searchable, and you write in them using "markdown," which lets you easily and quickly format headings, lists, bold, italics, or share an image, etc.
