Shelf mark: qB/TU/MIT Vol. 4 ff.441 Horizon No.: 1361550</p>One sheet of folio paper, four surfaces photographed.This letter appears to be a fragment, cut off in mid-sentence at the bottom of the fourth leaf. Evidently missing another leaf of paper, presumably surrounding this, and missing address leaf.<p>Hands other than Mitford's noted on this manuscript: </p>
            <ul>
               <li> Red crayon or thick red pencil. Probably a different hand from Mitford's that marks many of her letters, sometimes drawing diagonal lines across pages, and sometimes writing words overtop and perpendicularly across Mitford's writing. On this letter, a red line is drawn from the top center diagonally slightly left to the bottom of the first page, and then is drawn in the usual way from top left to bottom right of each of the other leaves.</li>
               <li> Someone, apparently other than Mitford, perhaps cataloging letters and describing them, who left grey pencil marks and numbered her letters now in the Reading Central Library's collection. This letter is numbered "16" in the top left of the first leaf, underneath the opening line, "To Sir W. Elford."
           </li>
            </ul>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary.

                    Poet, playwright, writer of prose fiction sketches, Mary Russell Mitford is, of course, the subject of our archive. Much of her writing was devoted to supporting herself and her parents. She received a civil list pension in 1837. Mitford's long life and prolific career ended after injuries from a carriage accident, and she is buried in
                        Swallowfield churchyard.
