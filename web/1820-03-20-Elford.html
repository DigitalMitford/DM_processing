                              of paper with correspondence on recto and verso 5-6. There is a gap on page
                              6 intended for an address. The pages are
                              folded in half and thirds twice more and were sealed for posting. It appears that pages 1-4 are two large sheets folded
                           in half; the last page (5-6) is one sheet. This letter is glued into a scrapbook. Address leaf bears a black circular

              end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford's
              spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate
              searching we are using the TEI elements "choice," "sic," and "reg" to encode both
              Mitford's spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling,

Died: 1817-07-18 in Winchester, Hampshire. <br/>Novelist celebrated for her wit and style, whose works investigated women's social and economic vulnerabilities in English society. During her lifetime she published Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814), and Emma (1815), all anonymously. Northanger Abbey, the first written of her novels (composed in 1798-1799) was published posthumously in 1818 along with her last finished novel, Persuasion. Mitford claims in a letter to Sir William Elford of 3 April 1815 that she has recently discovered Austen "is my countrywoman,", that is, a neighbor. Later in a letter of 2 July 1816 praised Emma in particular among Austen's novels. She and Elford evidently knew the identity of Austen as the author long before the information was public knowledge, and she claims in the April 3 letter that her mother remembered Jane in her youth as "the prettiest, silliest, most affected, husband-hunting butterfly she ever remembers", but that Jane was by the 1810s extremely quiet, which impressed Mitford: "till Pride and Prejudice showed what a precious gem was hidden in that unbending case, she was no more regarded in society than a poker or a fire-screen, or any other thin upright piece of wood or iron that fills its corner in peace and quietness. The case is very different now; she is still a poker--but a poker of whom every one is afraid. It must be confessed that this silent observation from such an observer is rather formidable. Most writers are good-humoured chatterers--neither very wise nor very witty:--but nine times out of ten (at least in the few that I have known) unaffected and pleasant, and quite removing by their conversation any awe that may have been excited by their works. But a wit, a delineator of character, who does not talk, is terrific indeed!" [Source: L'Estrange.]--#ebb</span>
