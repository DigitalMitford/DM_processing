                     She has written and maintains the project’s adapation of the TEI, and she manages
                     the coding and programming involved in storing, publishing, and sharing the project’s
                     editions and prosopography data. With Gregory Bondar, she has worked on photographing
                     Mitford’s manuscripts at the Reading Central Library and the John Rylands Library,
                     and she is involved in editing letters and plays, and in training editors and assistants
                     in TEI XML and related coding and programming for the project at the Digital Mitford
                     Coding School. Dr. Beshero-Bondar researches British Romanticism in poetry and drama
                     from the 1790s - 1830s. Her book about women Romantic poets, <i>Women, Epic, and Transition in British Romanticism</i>, was published by the University of Delaware Press in 2011. Her published articles
                     in <i>ELH</i>, <i>Genre</i>, <i>Philological Quarterly</i>, and <i>The Wordsworth Circle</i> investigate the poetry of Robert Southey, Mary Russell Mitford, and Lord Byron in
                     context with 18th- and 19th-century views of revolution, world empires, natural sciences,
                     and theater productions. An active member of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), she
                     was elected to serve on from 2016 to 2017 on the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Council/">TEI Technical Council</a>, an eleven-member international committee that supervises amendments to the TEI Guidelines.
                     Dr. Beshero-Bondar is Associate Professor of English and Director of the <a href="http://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/digital-humanities/center-digital-text">Center for the Digital Text</a> at Pitt-Greensburg, where she helps coordinate a <a href="http://greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/info/digital-studies">Digital Studies certificate program</a> for undergraduates. </span></span><h4>Managing Editor</h4><span class="entry"><span class="head">Lisa M.

                     and literary celebrity. Her work on Digital Mitford thus far includes editing and
                     coding Mitford’s <i>Introduction</i> to her collected <i>Dramatic Works</i> (1854), a critical memoir that recounts the author’s influences and experiences at
                     Covent Garden and Drury Lane in the 1820s and 30s. It also includes researching Mitford’s

                     coding, and researching Mitford’s letters from 1819 to the early 1820s and on Mitford’s
                     early poems.
