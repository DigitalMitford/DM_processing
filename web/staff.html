                     researches British Romanticism in poetry and drama from the 1790s - 1830s. Her

                        Romanticism</i>, was published by the University of Delaware Press in 2011.

                     Robert Southey, Mary Russell Mitford, and Lord Byron in context with 18th- and
                     19th-century views of revolution, world empires, natural sciences, and theater
                     productions. An active member of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), she was

                     Drury Lane in the 1820s and 30s. It also includes researching Mitford’s
                     publication history for the site’s working bibliography, particularly tracking
                     the migration of Mitford’s stories from their first publication to their later
                     reappearances in collections and periodicals. A Founding Editor of Digital
