                     She maintains <a href="https://digitalmitford.github.io/DM_documentation/">the project’s documentation</a> and manages the programming involved in storing, checking, and publishing the project’s
                     editions and prosopography data, as well as <a href="https://digitalmitford.github.io/DM_documentation/MitfordODD/mitfordODD.html">its customization of the TEI Guidelines</a>. With Gregory Bondar, she has photographed Mitford’s manuscripts at the Reading Central
                     Library and the John Rylands Library. She is involved in preparing and checking editions
                     of letters and plays, and leads the training of editors and assistants in TEI XML
                     and related coding and programming at the Digital Mitford Coding School. Her work
                     on the Digital Mitford project began with research of Mitford for her book about women
                     Romantic poets, <i>Women, Epic, and Transition in British Romanticism</i>, published by the University of Delaware Press in 2011. Her published articles in
                     <i>ELH</i>, <i>Genre</i>, <i>Philological Quarterly</i>, and <i>The Wordsworth Circle</i> investigate the poetry of Robert Southey, Mary Russell Mitford, and Lord Byron in
                     context with 18th- and 19th-century views of revolution, world empires, natural sciences,
                     and theater productions. An active member of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), she
                     has served since 2016 on the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Council/">TEI Technical Council</a>, an eleven-member international committee that supervises amendments to the <a href="https://tei-c.org/guidelines/P5/">TEI Guideline</a>s.</span></span><h4>Managing Editor</h4><span class="entry"><span class="head">Lisa M.

                     such as the Gothic novel and the literary ballad. She is also interested in book history
                     and bibliographical studies, particularly in the study of authorship in the long nineteenth
                     century (1780-1900). She has published in <i>European Romantic Review</i>, <i>Romanticism on the Net</i> (now <i>RaVon</i>), <i>Romantic Circles</i>, <i>Romantic Textualities</i>, and elsewhere. She is currently working on a monograph on Romantic-period authorship
                     and literary celebrity. Her work on Digital Mitford thus far includes editing and
                     coding Mitford’s <i>Introduction</i> to her collected <i>Dramatic Works</i> (1854), a critical memoir that recounts the author’s influences and experiences at
                     Covent Garden and Drury Lane in the 1820s and 30s. It also includes researching Mitford’s
                     publication history for the site’s working bibliography, particularly tracking the
                     migration of Mitford’s stories from their first publication to their later reappearances
                     in collections and periodicals. A Founding Editor of Digital Mitford, she and her
                     teams of student research assistants have been at work since 2013 on transcribing,
                     coding, and researching Mitford’s letters from 1819 to the early 1820s and on Mitford’s
                     early poems.
