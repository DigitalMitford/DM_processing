I care not to know his name. . . but let me take this opportunity to assure him, that, as a man, I hold him in the most sovereign contempt, not to say detestation!" (page 438)</span>. In his prompt rejoinder, Haydon identified himself as the "living artist," and described the circumstances of the encounter: "About eight years ago, while the living Artist alluded to was accidentally approaching <span class="context" title="place">Temple Bar<span class="si">Temple | neighborhood of central London, a central area for law offices and legal practice, with
                     its four Inns of Court. The Inner Temple, one of the four Inns of Court, was

He ran on with many other gentlemen and squeezing near enough to give her aid, found a poor creature turning her head from one side ot the other, beating away the people who offered to calm her, and screaming on 'her dear boy' with a dry, parched, agitated hoarseness!--The people at last forced her into a house, and upon his inquiring what had happened, he found that she had permitted her boy to hold a horse and to mount it, and that the poor little fellow had been thrown and trampled on.

Haydon continues that the child did not die of the accident, that the  mother's face did not stare rigidly but was luridly animated, and that "The living Artist has often related this affecting incident to his friends, and has added, that his coming in contact with such a dreadful expression in Nature, at the very moment he was painting the real mother in the <span class="context" title="title">Judgment of Solomon<span class="si">The Judgment of Solomon.

Assumptions and bitter accusations in the matter led to a bitter personal conflict aired in the pages of Blackwood's and The London Magazine resulting in the death by duel of The London Magazine's editor, John Scott in February 1821, at the hands of Lockhart's literary agent Jonathan Christie. Lockhart married Walter Scott's daughter Sophia in 1820, which caused John Scott and others to assume that Walter Scott had some involvement with Blackwood's campaign against the Cockneys. Lockhart took over the editorship of the Quarterly Reviewfrom March 1826 until June 1853, shortly before his death. He is perhaps best known as the author of his father-in-law's 7-volume biography, Life of Walter Scott, published in 1837-1838.--#ebb</span>

Scott's editorship lasted until his death by duel on 27 February 1821 resulting form bitter personal conflict with the editors of Blackwood's Magazine connected with their insulting characterization of a LondonCockney School.
