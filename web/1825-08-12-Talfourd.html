                    Poet, playwright, writer of prose fiction sketches, Mary Russell Mitford is, of course, the subject of our archive. Much of her writing was devoted to supporting herself and her parents. She received a civil list pension in 1837. Mitford's long life and prolific career ended after injuries from a carriage accident, and she is buried in
                        Swallowfield churchyard.

Died: 1869-11-11 in the deanery at Battle. <br/>A lifelong friend of MRM who knew her from their childhood in the 1790s, Harness wrote Mitford's biography, which was published after his own death in 1870. Harness and Byron were also friends from their schooling at Harrow, as Byron sympathized with Harness's experience of a disabled foot, crushed in an accident in early childhood. Byron considered dedicating the first two cantos of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage to Harness, but refrained so as not to taint Harness's reputation as he was taking orders as an Anglican curate. Harness admired and encouraged Mitford's playwrighting in particular, and she commented that he was one of the few of her friends who thought she should prioritize the drama over prose. When William Macready was attacked in an anonymous Blackwood's Magazine piece in 1825 for his demands and rudeness to Mitford over revisions to Rienzi, Macready assumed that Harness was the author of the anonymous piece, though in 1839 after many years of distance, Harness assured Macready in person that he was not the writer, though he may have shared word of the poor treatment his friend had endured.
