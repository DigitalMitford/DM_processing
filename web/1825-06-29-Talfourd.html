                    Poet, playwright, writer of prose fiction sketches, Mary Russell Mitford is, of course, the subject of our archive. Much of her writing was devoted to supporting herself and her parents. She received a civil list pension in 1837. Mitford's long life and prolific career ended after injuries from a carriage accident, and she is buried in
                        Swallowfield churchyard.

                           Dickens dedicated The Pickwick Papers to
                        Talfourd. Talfourd’s best-known works include his plays Ion (1835), The Athenian Captive (1837) and Glencoe, or the Fate of the MacDonalds

                     on June 20, 1825 from Blackwoods. The letter is signed by
                     Philo-Dramaticus, and urges Charles Kemble and Robert Elliston, managers of Covent Garden and Drury Lane, respectively, to resist the demands of the leading actors of the day, which Philo-Dramaticus sees as ruining the theater. The letter specifically identifies Edmund Kean, Charles Young, and William Macready. Such demands include insisting on a limited run of performances and rewrites from the authors of plays to suit the actors' tastes. The letter refers to the changes that Macready required for Mitford's play Rienzi.--#kdc</span>

                        Westminster. One of the "patent theaters." First theater on this site was
                        opened in 1732 by John Rich, renovated by architect Henry Holland in 1792,
                        and destroyed by fire on 20 Sept. 1808. The second theater, designed by
                        Robert Smirke, opened on 18 Sept. 1809, managed by John Phillip Kemble. Because of rent
                        increases by the Duke of Bedford, the landowner, J.P. Kemble increased
                        ticket prices. This led to the "old price (or O.P.) riots" and the eventual
                        lowering of ticket prices, although the proprietors proved they would lose
                        money at those prices. The second theater was destroyed by fire on 5 March
                        1856. The third theater, designed by Edward Middleton Barry, opened in 1858
                        and remains the nucleus of today's theater. The theater became the Royal
                        Opera House in 1892 and the building was renovated and expaneded in the
                        1980s and 1990s.--#lmw</span>
