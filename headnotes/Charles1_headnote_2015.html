               territory in the London theatre of the long eighteenth century. True, the <span class="date" title="1660">1660</span> Act of Indemnity and Oblivion criminalized any discussion of the Regicide that might
               serve to “revive the memory of the late differences,” or to investigate any surviving

               hopes for a future in which their religious and political ideals would not be condemned.
               When the historian and “Republican Virago”<span class="person">Catharine Macaulay</span> (1731-91) implored the Hutchinson descendant <span class="person">Sir Thomas Hutchinson</span> to publish the memoir, he refused. It first appeared, with a profusion of Whiggish
