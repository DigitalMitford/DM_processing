              <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

            <p>I have waited till the last post day in hopes of seeing <persName ref="#Walter_Mary">Mrs. Walter</persName> &amp; finding from her if you were
               expected at <placeName ref="#Bear_Wood">Bear Wood</placeName> on Sunday, but she has not called here nor have
               I been able to get to her, as my <rs type="person" ref="#Mitford_Geo">father</rs> although very much recovered has not been well enough to take
               so long a ride. We have not heard anything of your being expected there, &amp; I
               in hoping to meet you on Monday spoke rather from my wishes than from rational
               expectation, therefore I should not imagine they would be offended if you did
               not go--but I am quite sure that to see you whether they have written or not
               would be the greatest possible pleasure both to <rs type="person" ana="#Walter_John #Walter_Mary">Mr. and Mrs. Walter</rs>--I never heard any
               thing more enthusiastic<pb n="2"/> than the way in which she spoke of you--if I
               may venture to advise you--Go! &amp; I say this quite disinterestedly since I am
               afraid you would think it necessary to run away before the dinner party next
               day.--</p>
            <p>I have heard very fully and kindly from <persName ref="#Harness_Wm">Mr.
               Harness</persName>--He had not seen <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Charles
                  Kemble</persName> but seemed quite sure that the <rs type="title" ref="#CharlesI_MRMplay">

               <placeName ref="#Covent_Garden_Theatre">Covent Garden</placeName>, &amp;
               that the consciousness of that, (although no <rs type="person" ref="#Kemble_C">Manager</rs>

               was the real cause of <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Mr. Kemble</persName>'s advice.
