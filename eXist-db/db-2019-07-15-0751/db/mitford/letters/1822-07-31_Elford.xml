So here I am writing--I can't get a frank though within the appointed time--but you are ^(not. like we poor Authors), &amp; would I believe rather pay for a letter than <!--scribble: get --> not get one--So here I am--resolved to make the most of a sheet for your satisfaction. In the first place I should scold you for not telling me exactly how you srm is, if the steady writing of that delightful letter were not a proof that it is getting strength--In the second I prefer, I think, of two very good Inscriptions the second--that which begins with "not only"--&amp; would I think stop at "Institution"--But I am no judge at all of this sort of writing--It is a very gratifying compliment to his suviving <!--scribble--> family--Pray have you heard (talking of monuments) the strange story of Lord Ryson's consignment to Mr. Murray? It may be in the newspapers--for I do not see them--but it came to me in the freshness of M.S. from a literary friend &amp; I shall tell you the story at a venture. Lord Byron has sent to Murray a dead child to be interred in the Harrow Churchyard in a spot particularly pointed out with directions to have a splendid Mausoleum erected <!--scribble: to--> over itbut if that be not permitted, then a Tablet is to be placed in a part of the Church also indicated where his eye used to rest while <pb n="2"/> a school boy with the Inscription "He shall not come to me but I shall go to him." Very appropriate when one remembers on what occasion David spoke those words.--Many thanks for the Scott story--It looks like confession--but I have no doubt. I agree with you that there is an infinite charm in the Fortunes of Nigel--in the manners &amp; characters--King Jamie above all--the love sotry is of course nothing, &amp; rather worse than nothing--for certainly the heroine is by no means pretty behaved--but there is a life, a vitality about it--"There is so much salt that it will keep"--to parody Dr. Johnson's expression respecting the Rehearsal--&amp; above all there are no witches--thank Heaven! I hope he has done with them. Halidon Hill was a most complete &amp; confortable failure--Did you not think so?--for the which I also laud the Gods--If he had once taken to play writing the Lord of mercy upon us poor spinsters of Tragedy--He would have supplied Covent Garden, Drury Lane, the Haymarket, the Cobourg, the <!--??--> the very English Opera House!--But Haildon Hill is a Damper--&amp; his reputation is so splendid &amp; so various that he can afford to have failed in the one little point with regards to which he was himself so doubtful--My Tragedy with its <emph rend="underline">new</emph> Fifth Act is still with Mr. Kemble--&amp; <!-- scribble: still --> will remain there of course.--Till I hear whether he wishes for any farther alteration I have no legible copy, &amp; scarcely the heart to make one--So that I cannot gratify your kind curiosity. I do hope that some time next season I shall be able to send it to you in print--which will be every way more satisfactory. But really I try all I can not to think about it--I have been so worn out with expectation &amp; anxiety &amp; alteration. You will find it very different from the trumpery I used to write--though still too womanish.--Our Poet here Mr. Milman is in Italy--Did I tell you a little story of him in my last? I think <pb n="3"/> not. If I did you must forgive the repetition. He was you must know a sun-worshipper--a salamander--never hot in his life, seldom warm--Well about 6 weeks ago her was met by a gentleman in this neighborhood half way up a hill in Italy--his coat &amp; waistcoat on one side of him--his hat with his neck-cloth in it on the other-- &amp; himself in the act of diversting himself of another article of his habiliments (in short his drawers) intending to accomplish the rest of the hill in his shirt &amp; trowsers. You don't know the man I believe--so can scarcely image to yourself what a perfection of gawkiness that uncravatted craggy neck would exhibit!--Really--I ought not to laugh at him--for he is very kind to me--don't give me for your authority if you should happen to tell the story.--<metamark rend="jerks"/>We have had today a very great &amp; unexpected pleasure--that of hearing from a friend whom we had entirely lost sight of during fifteen years. She was then a most interesting young women in most interesting circumstances. <!-- gap --> her husband, a young Officer in the guards the eldest son of a man of large property, had been taken prisoners during their bridal tour &amp; shut up at Verdun--After a long detention <emph rend="underline">she</emph> obtained leave to <!-- above: to arrange for  remittance--> return home &amp; brought with her her little boy--She was in London then &amp; so were we I passed much time together--when she had acomplished her business, she took her passage <!--scribble, two words--> to return to her husband--when suddenly her father in law declared that she might go if she chose but that her boy should stay--he would not have his heir brought up on a foreign Country--It was a terrible struggle--but she did rightly as I think--she joined her husband &amp; left the child with its Grandfather. Since then we have never heard <pb n="4"/> till today--She had lost our address in the Country-- &amp; only found us out accidentally through the insertion of my Father's name in some justicing affair in the Windsor Paper where they are quartered. ONly think what a pleasure it will be to see her--<!-- Maura? --> and her Mothers were old friends, so that we were so very intimate--But now we shall be all altered! She is I see just the same from her letter--just as kind &amp; warm hearted &amp; charming as ever--but to think of that lovely young woman with a parcel of great boys &amp; girls--that is astounding enough--but nothing to what she will feel in seeing the little shy quiet girl she remembers so kindly turned into a person of my rotundity--an old maid--&amp; an Authoress that is the worst part of the business--I am afraid she will be safly shocked at that.--the lady of an Officer in the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Life Guards must of necessity &amp; of <!--unclear--> have a great horror of a person who writes at so much per sheet!--Goodbye my very dear friend--On looking over this letter I see that it seems <emph rend="underline">fatigued</emph>--which I supposed because I that write it am fixed with a long ride &amp; walk yesterday--ride &amp; walk yesterday--ride &amp; walk &amp; talk--for it was the last I believe that did me up--I went with a young friend to shew her Silchester &amp; really when we came back we were both forced

As Mitford writes a complimentary close broken out into lines, indicate it with line breaks using the self-closing <lb/> element.  Here's an example:
            <closer>
            Yours<lb/>
            Very sincerely<lb/>
            <persName ref="#MRM">M. R. Mitford</persName>.
            </closer>
            --><lb/>
               <!--Another line in the closer, if present--><lb/>
               <persName ref="#MRM"><!--How Mitford signs her name. For example: M. R. Mitford--></persName>. 
            </closer> 
            
            <postscript><p><!--A postscript goes here, outside the <closer>. --></p></postscript><!--You can include a <pb/> here, or inside the postScript.--><!-- Format for postscripts.  Postscripts do NOT go inside closer tags. Adjust to take into account the order in your letter. Sometimes the signature is on page three, the address on page four, then the postscript follows back on the top of page one, for example.-->
            
             <closer><!--Use the <closer> element again to hold Address Leaf information, indicating where Mitford directed her letter.-->
               <address> <!--Include any text written on the address leaf; use a separate "addrLine" for each line and indicate line breaks. Closer tags must also enclose the address section. NOTE AGAIN: If Mitford has a postscript, that postcript must *not* be enclosed in the closer tags, even when they are written after the signature and before the address. It's a TEI rule (sigh). -->
            <addrLine><!--Text of a line on the address leaf, with context coding and superscripts indicated. For example: To T. N. Talfourd--></addrLine>
                  <addrLine><!--Text of a line on the address leaf, with context coding and superscripts indicated. For example: No. 1 Pump Court--></addrLine>
                  <addrLine><!--Text of a line on the address leaf, with context coding and superscripts indicated. For example: Temple--></addrLine>
                  <!--Some address leaves may have a name and city in the bottom left; this indicates the person who franked the letter, usually a Member of Parliament whom Mitford knows. Tag as an additional address line. For example: <persName ref="#Monck_JB">J. B. Monck</persName> <placeName ref="#Plymouth_city">Plymouth</placeName>-->
