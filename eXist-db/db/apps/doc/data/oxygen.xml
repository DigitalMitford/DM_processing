                eXist-db. While the oXygen documentation describes <ulink url="http://oxygenxml.com/xml_editor/eXist_support.html">oXygen's eXist-db
                    support</ulink>, we provide up-to-date information here for the convenience of
                eXist-db users.</para></section><section id="setup"><title>How to tell oXygen about your eXist-db installation</title><para>To tap into eXist-db via oXygen, you must tell oXygen a bit about your eXist-db
                installation. The steps to do this are admittedly too tedious, but you only need to
                perform these steps once. First, we need to create an entry for eXist-db in oXygen's
                list of Data Sources; this involves pointing oXygen to 5 key libraries (.jar files)
                in our eXist-db directory so that oXygen knows how to connect to our version of
                eXist-db. Then we need to create an entry in its list of Data Connections; this
                involves providing oXygen with a URL and account information for your eXist-db
                instance.</para><procedure><step><para>In oXygen, go to Preferences &gt; Data Sources, and you will see a window
                        with two areas: Data Sources (on the top) and Connections (on the bottom).

                        files so that they appear in the Driver files area: <orderedlist><listitem><para>exist.jar</para></listitem><listitem><para>lib/core/ws-commons-1.0.2.jar</para></listitem><listitem><para>lib/core/xmldb.jar</para></listitem><listitem><para>lib/core/xmlrpc-client-3.1.3.jar</para></listitem><listitem><para>lib/core/xmlrpc-common-3.1.3.jar</para></listitem></orderedlist></para></step><step><para>Select OK to complete the creation of the new Data Source and return to
                        the Data Sources screen, where will will create a new Data Connection to
                        your eXist-db installation. In the "Connections" area of the screen, select
                        the <guibutton>Add</guibutton> button to creat a new data connection.</para></step><step><para>A new dialog will appear, with fields for Name, Type, and Driver

                        service (e.g., http://localhost:8080/exist/xmlrpc). oXygen v14 and higher
                        allow you to make the connection between oXygen and eXist-db secure and
                        SSL-encrypted; to do so select the checkbox, "Use a Secure HTTPS Connection
                        (SSL)", and use your eXist-db's secure port for the XML DB URI (e.g.,
                        https://localhost:8443/exist/xmlrpc).</para></step><step><para>In the User and Password fields, enter your eXist-db account details
                        (e.g., typically, the "admin" user and associated password that you set up
                        when you installed eXist-db).</para></step><step><para>In the Collection field, enter "/db".</para></step><step><para>Select OK to complete the creation of the new Data Connection. Select OK
                        to exit oXygen's Preferences. Congratulations! You have told oXygen

                            you can browse collections and their contents; you can right click on

                Saxon is a fine tool for validating XQuery (among its many capabilities), but it
                lacks knowledge of eXist-db built-in functions and other settings. Thus, if you are
                ultimately creating XQuery to use in eXist-db, you will find numerous advantages in
                configuring oXygen to use eXist-db for validation instead of Saxon. The steps to
                complete this configuration are very easy:</para><procedure><step><para>In oXygen, go to Preferences &gt; XQuery. On the dropdown menu labeled,
                        "XQuery Validate with", select the name of the Data Connection that you
                        created above.</para><para>Select OK to confirm your new preference.</para></step></procedure><para>Now when you are editing an XQuery file in oXygen, the validation information you
                receive (i.e., when you click on the <guibutton>Validate</guibutton> toolbar button)
                is supplied from eXist-db.</para></section><section id="executing-queries"><title>How to execute queries and display results</title><para>You can execute queries against eXist-db from within oXygen. To do so:</para><procedure><step><para>Open an XQuery file that you would like to execute.</para></step><step><para>Select the <guibutton>Configure Transformation Scenario</guibutton>

                        "XQuery Transformation" in the dropdown menu.</para></step><step><para>A new dialog will appear with fields to configure your XQuery
                        transformation settings. Enter a Name for the transformation (e.g.,
                        "Transform with eXist-db"). In the "Transformer" dropdown menu, select the
                        name of the Data Connection that you created above.</para></step><step><para>Select OK to confirm these settings, and then select "Save and Close" to
                        exit the configuration window, or select the <guibutton>Apply
