 : This module provides the functions that control the Web presentation
 : of xqDoc. The logic contained in this module is not specific to any
 : XQuery implementation and is written to the May 2003 XQuery working
 : draft specification. It would be a trivial exercise to convert this
 : code to either the Nov 2003 or Oct 2004 XQuery working draft.
 :
 : It should also be noted that these functions not only support the 
 : real-time presentation of the xqDoc information but are also used
 : for the static offline presentation mode as well. The static offline
 : presentation mode has advantages because access to a native XML
 : database is not needed when viewing the xqDoc information ... it is
 : only needed when generating the offline materials.
