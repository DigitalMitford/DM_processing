               house at no greater expense than that of listening to a good deal of flattery &amp;
               paying it by some half dozen smiling words I determined to try what I could do in the
               way of liking plays by going every night &amp; giving them a fair chance--Certain in
               the last resort that if I had no other pleasure I was quite sure of the <del rend="squiggles">great</del> comfort of finding fault.--Well on Wednesday I went
               to see <title ref="#Wallace_play">Wallace</title> the new tragedy &amp; <title ref="#Warlock_Play">The Warlock</title> the new melo drama (one is quite as much a
               melodrama as t'other by the bye) both by the same author, &amp; that author a lad of
               nineteen, son of <persName ref="#Walker_P">Peter Walker</persName> the Westminster
               Patriot. <title ref="#Wallace_play">Wallace</title> is very well-- considering--a
               good deal of stage effect--&amp; some fine situations -- there is no promise in
               it--no luxuriance to prune away -- no glorious faults--the author will never write
               better--but as he never means to write again that does not much signify--he got up
               these two things merely to earn money enough to pay his expenses at <placeName ref="#Oxford_Univ">Oxford</placeName> for a year or two--&amp; is I hear a modest
               meritorious youth. <title ref="#Wallace_play">Wallace</title> is <pb n="2"/> a Miss
               Porterish<!--SCW: For later, we'll want to try to figure out what she means here-->
               person -- as little like the real <title ref="#Wallace_play">Wallace</title> as her
               hero--always praising &amp; puffing himself &amp; talking sentimentally to the woods
               &amp; mountains &amp; dropping his sword at the sound of treachery (the real Wallace
               would have cloven men into the earth first &amp; been shocked at this treachery
               afterwards) &amp; leaving his fate to this wife's decision &amp; so forth. To redeem
               these faults he had two great merits--he was born before the invention of gunpowder,
               &amp; he is acted by <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">W. Macready</persName>--who to say
               nothing of his being really a very fine &amp; enthusiastic actor has a voice which is
               as delicious to hear as the finest music, &amp; gives like that a pleasure totally
               unconnected with the words which he has to offer.--By the way <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">W. M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>cready</persName> is likewise

               other melodramas neither better nor worse--except that it has one laudable
               peculiarity--there is no ruffian stalking about with pistols in his girdle to
               frighten one out of one's own wits--the assassins kill people with swords as

               between the copy and the original--cold &amp; dead &amp; the shadow of a shade--no
