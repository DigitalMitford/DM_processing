Where were we in that equally doleful &amp; comical history? Had I told you that the Play was written under advice<pb n="2" facs="3Jan1822 Sir WilliamElford2d.JPG"/> which seemed excellent for three principal characters--<persName ref="#Young_Mr">Young</persName> <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Charles Kemble</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Macready</persName>--that <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Charles Kemble</persName> from disgust at the other two had seceded, <metamark rend="caret" place="below"/><add place="above">from the Theatre</add>, &amp; that in consequence of alterations suggested by Mr. Macready Mr. Young's character had become too unimportant for a man of his dignity--in the language of a Charade my second had quarreled with my first &amp; my third <add place="above">affronted my second &amp; extinguished</add><del rend="squiggles"/><!--LMW: not sure how many words/letters deleted.-->my first. The consequence of all this was easy to foresee--the play was presented to Mr. Harris, &amp; after a great deal of hesitation rejected in terms of such praise &amp; admiration, as would have satisfied any Author who wrote from Vanity--Mr. Macready says for my consolation that no refusal was ever so much like an acceptance--that Mr. Harris actually prefers it to a Tragedy which he has taken--&amp; that, in short, it has been refused merely because the state of the performers is such that it could not be acted with a fair chance of success. This is you see very poor consolation--Indeed I am not sure whether to have come so very near the mark is not more provoking than to have utterly failed--One comfort however there is--This Play has certainly cleared the way for most respectful attention to any piece that I may send in hereafter--And I have accordingly already begun Tragedy on a story purely imaginative which I intend to write without any respect for <metamark rend="caret" place="below"/><add place="above">the</add> Mr. Young's or the Charles Kembles, with one leading character for Mr. Macready &amp; a number of inferior ones which may be filled up my any walking Gentleman--walking sticks they might call them--which the Theatre may happen to have in pay. Don't you think I am very bold &amp; persevering? Pray praise me--&amp; pity me--I am forced to pity myself sometimes or I should never get on at all--I have entirely lost the fluency which I used to possess ten years <pb n="3" facs="3Jan1822 Sir WilliamElford3b#.JPG"/> ago &amp; write with a difficulty a labour a fastidiousness that seem almost incredible--besides ? every thing ? --nothing but the certain conviction that I should fail hinders me <persName ref="#Irving_Wash">Washington Irving</persName>
              
               from trying a Comedy. Mr. Talfourd says I should succeed--but I

               you will say no to both questions--you have not probably yet
               had time to read it--&amp; you have heard enough of the story to be
               pretty sure that you shall not like it. I don't at all. There is
               a great deal too much about Zetland superstitions &amp; Zetland
               manners, &amp; Zetland revelry--&amp; there is an old witch who
               would of herself be enough to spoil the finest thing that
               ever was written. What a fancy the great Unknown has for a
               witch! I verily believe this Norna is the 9th or 10th of that
               species which he has produced--&amp; of all of them she is the
               worst, by far the worst--he has given her a poem in prose
               to recite after the fashion of Ossian, Chateaubriand &amp; those 
               sort of people--&amp; there is such a quantity of her too! Altogether
               The Pirate is perhaps nearly on a par with the later works--for there
               has been nothing very great since Ivanhoe (notwithstanding
               the beauty of one or two scenes in the Monastery)--nothing like
               the Antiquary &amp; Waverley &amp; Guy Mannering &amp; Old Mortality--
               the Antiquary being to my taste the one &amp; unrivalled of them
               all. (By the bye in an article which ? strangely at
               ? purposes of the scotch hovels in the last ? ?
               Oldbuck &amp; Pleydell &amp; the high comic character called the
               "fool" &amp; "the Rose"--What manner of taste call you this?)
              --One of the best things in the Pirate is some excellent raillery
               on the subject of breeding clubs &amp; ?--&amp; the best
               one seems to be that where Mrs. ? produces her boiled goose

               you, for your reasons &amp; others, as to the certainty of the books

               his English details--Mr. Washington Irving is excellent in
               humour, &amp; in old dutch Colonists &amp; other American diversities--but
               he must not meddle with <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="3" unit="chars"/></del> us proud English--I wish he would
               give an American novel with all the peculiarities the vulgarities
               &amp; the affectations of that ridiculous country. We have a fine
               specimen of New York manners close by--a rich friend of ours was
               taken in by Mr. Birkbeck's fine plausible lies (there's a glorious
               illustration of my system for you--that book of Birkbeck's seemed as
               true as Robinson Crusoe!) &amp; intending to embark some 20 or 40,000(?)
               in the Illinois, sent out a son of seventeen to reconnoitre. Mr.
               Fearon's fine antidote &amp; other accounts soon determined him to keep

               returned--a very good sort of young man I believe, but the most
               complete transatlantic coxcomb that ever eyes beheld. He is
               somenm, smooth &amp; smirking--smiling like Malvolio though not

               have read it. you will find mention made of a little boy of the name
