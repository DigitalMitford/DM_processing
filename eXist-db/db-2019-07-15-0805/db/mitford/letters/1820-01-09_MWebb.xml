              <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

     <revisionDesc><!--2018-01-11 ebb: NEW: This last section of our TEI Header contains a change log, and documents each significant change to the file over time. This represents a simpler, cleaner encoding than the respStmts with comments that we started out using. We're going to (slowly) move the old respStmts from past edited letters into this format, but all new letters from this point ought to use it. -->

            <pb n="1" facs=""/><!--2018-01-11 ebb: This is another NEW practice: We need to locate and post the **best** image of each surface page of a letter (including the first page). (Previously we didn't include a <pb/> for page 1, but we need to do that now and work on adding this for previously encoded letters.) In the value of the @facs attribute, very carefully paste in the file name of the best image you have for this page in the Box directory for this letter. If you like two or three images of this page, you may include all three separated by a white space. Be sure to include the file extension thus:
            <pb n="1" facs="image1.jpg image2.jpg image3.jpg"/>
