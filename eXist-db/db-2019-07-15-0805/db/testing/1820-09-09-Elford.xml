I really think we go on quite as well without a subject as with one--the cobweb spins out to a good size--rather flimsy to be sure, &amp; not very durable--but there it is looking very happy &amp; comfortable these bright autumn mornings-- &amp; the poor little round spider snugs herself up in her hole and seems proud of her handywork <add>&amp; as soon as one is finished away begins another</add>.--So she shall spin on.

I did wait on her as I told you I should, &amp; think with you that she is a most delightful woman. I did not expect to find her still so very handsome--but the best parts of beauty, grace intelligence &amp; and <choice><sic>goodhumour</sic><reg>good humour</reg></choice> are those which last the longest, &amp; and that pretty Scotch voice is enchanting. We talked a great deal of you--&amp; of <placeName ref="#Devonshire_county">Devonshire</placeName>--which she admires with her whole heart--&amp; she says things of you--It is very well that <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Mr. Palmer</persName> was out of hearing--there is no love lost beween you <unclear><supplied resp="#lmw">I assure</supplied></unclear> you. In short I was quite charmed with every thing about her but her <persName ref="#Queen_Caroline">Queen</persName> madness which burst forth suddenly on the appearance of <title ref="#Times_news">the Times</title> &amp; sent me off in a hurry. Had she this frenzy-fever in <placeName ref="#Devonshire">Devonshire</placeName> or has she caught it from <rs type="person" ref="#Palmer_CF">her husband</rs>? <orgName ref="#Palmerite">He &amp; his brother members &amp; his precious constituents</orgName> are alike insane upon this subject. Indeed to do <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> justice it never is behindhand in any<pb n="2"/> folly stirring. They had a meeting to address the <persName ref="#Queen_Caroline">Queen</persName>--&amp; voted said address--&amp; sent up their worthy members to present it--&amp; up they went in all their paraphernalia--&amp; the gracious <persName ref="#Queen_Caroline">Queen</persName> never spoke to them!

Did I ever talk to you of <orgName ref="#Monck_family">the Moncks</orgName>? <persName ref="#Monck_JB">He</persName> is a very extraordinary man--a great Grecian--&amp; more like an old philosopher than anything you ever saw--I defy anything or anybody to put him out of humour--he has not of course though a clever man, <del rend="squiggles">any thing</del><add place="above">much</add> of <persName ref="#Fox_ChasJ">Charles Fox</persName>'s powers or eloquence, but he is more like him in point of character than any man that ever lived--full of kindheartedness &amp; of a tolerant humanity--more generally beloved by man woman &amp; child than any person I ever heard of--Dividing his whole time between literature &amp; usefulness &amp; family affection. <persName ref="#Monck_Mrs">His wife</persName> is a pretty lively chatty woman kind &amp; good humored--entirely without her <choice><sic>husband's</sic><reg>husband's</reg></choice> largeness &amp; liberality of mind--not even understanding the breadth &amp; depth of his character--but in whom good habits &amp; kindly prejudices produce nearly the same effect. She loves his <metamark place="below" function="insertion" rend="caret"/><add place="above">old</add> friends because they are old friends, &amp; is good to the poor because she has been used to <del rend="strikethrough" unit="word" quantity="1">it.</del><add place="above">be charitable.</add>--She has returned from a three years &amp; a half tour through <placeName ref="#France">France</placeName><placeName ref="#Italy">Italy</placeName><placeName ref="#Switzerland">Switzerland</placeName> &amp; <placeName ref="#Germany">Germany</placeName> without having brought back a single new feeling or left behind one old one.

She took up her <placeName ref="#Coley_Berks">Coley</placeName> habits, as if she had only laid them aside <pb n="3"/> the night before with her clothes, &amp; the presence of a sweet little girl of three years old born in <placeName ref="#France">France</placeName> &amp; and not speaking a word of English seems necessary to convince one that the Mother has ever set her foot on the Continent. This identity of character has a great charm with me--I never liked <persName ref="#Monck_Mrs">Mrs. Monck</persName> half so well in my life as since she returned so perfectly the same as she went. Besides we agree like two drops of water. She hates her <choice><sic>husbands</sic><reg>husband's</reg></choice> parliamenting. So do I. She sickens at the name of <persName ref="#Queen_Caroline">Queen Caroline</persName>. So do I. She thinks <placeName ref="#Mortimer_Comm">Mortimer Common</placeName> the prettiest place in the world. So do I. She detests <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> and its doings. So do I.--<placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> is at present <persName ref="#Queen_Caroline">Queen</persName> mad. It reads &amp; talks &amp; dreams &amp; lies of nothing else--&amp; engrafts a clumsy and awkward licentiousness on its original vulgarity &amp; dullness. After all the crying evil of this frightful enquiry is its tendency to confound right &amp; wrong. Those who dislike the <persName ref="#GeoIV">King</persName>'s immorality think themselves bound by the duty of party to palliate the much grosser and more horrible conduct of the <persName ref="#Queen_Caroline">Queen</persName>, &amp; we hear of <q>"little indiscretions"</q> &amp; <q>"too great condescensions"</q> &amp; such paltering with vice from the very lips of the stern mentors who thunder at the crimes of Kings &amp; the wickedness of Ministers. This must be wrong--there can only be one Virtue &amp; one Wickedness. Besides the <persName ref="#Queen_Caroline">Queen</persName>'s <del rend="squiggles">conduct</del><add place="above">defence</add> throws a stain &amp; a slur upon womanhood--She seeks to cover her enormous crime with a cloak of innocence &amp; purity &amp; profanes the sacred &amp; holy name of matronly virtue by asserting her claim to it. Chastity is become a <choice><sic>byeword</sic><reg resp="#lmw">byword</reg></choice> &amp; a jest--She is to womanly purity, what a false prophet is to religion. She can not alter the eternal truth--but she can give mockers &amp; scoffers a pretence to doubt <choice><sic>it's</sic><reg>its</reg></choice> existence. Many years must pass away before the effect of this ceases &amp; modesty shall become <pb n="4"/> again a holy thing.
