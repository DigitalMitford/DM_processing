Zanoa:  "To strike thee with astonishment at once,/I hate Alonzo. First recover that,/And then thou shalt hear farther."</note> I am so busy.  Since I came back from <placeName ref="#London_city">London</placeName> I have written a <title ref="#Fiesco_play">Tragedy</title> on the subject of <persName ref="#Fieschi_GL">Fiesco</persName> the Genoese Nobleman who conspired against <persName ref="#Doria_Andrea">Doria</persName>--the story is beautifully told in <persName ref="#Robertson_Wm">Robertson</persName>'s <title>Charles the Fifth</title>--This <title ref="#Fiesco_play">Tragedy</title> is now in <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName>'s hands--I suppose I shall hear in a day or two that its rejected--&amp; the moment I hear that I shall fall to ding dong &amp; write another.  For I have an inward consciousness that any little talent I may have is altogether dramatic and having placed before my eyes the example of <persName ref="#Tobin_John">Mr. Tobin</persName> whose <title ref="#Honeymoon_play">Honeymoon</title> was produced after <emph rend="underline">eleven</emph> other Plays <metamark rend="caret" function="insertion" place="below"/><add place="above">of his composing</add> had been rejected (I don't mean to follow his example in dying though before my successful Play is brought out) I am determined to persevere &amp; to write a good Tragedy at last even if I previously write eleven bad ones.  This I am resolved on. In the mean time I am writing for the magazines--Poetry criticism &amp; Dramatic Sketches--I work as hard as a lawyer's clerk &amp; besides the natural loathing of pen &amp; ink which that sort of drudgery cannot fail to inspire I have really at present scarcely a moment to spare even to the violets and primroses. You would laugh if you saw me puzzling over my prose--You have no notion how much difficulty I find in writing any thing at all readable.  One cause of this is my having been so egregious a letter writer--I have accustomed myself to a certain careless sauciness, a fluent incorrectness which passed very well with indulgent Friends such as yourself, my dear <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William</persName> but will not do at all for that tremendous Correspondent the Public--so I ponder over every <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1"/>phrase<pb n="2"/>--disjoint every sentence &amp; finally produce such lumps of awkwardness I really expect instead of paying me for them <persName ref="#Colburn">Mr. Colburn</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#Baldwin_R">Mr. Baldwin</persName> will send me back the trash. But I will improve. This is another resolution which is as fixed as fate.--Well--I am now going to make a strange request--Will you my dear Friend have the goodness to <emph rend="underline">lend</emph> me those letters of mine which you have taken the trouble to keep. I am not going to publish them--of that you may be sure. But without partaking of your kind delusion as to their merits I am aware that there are in them occasional passages &amp; expressions which being written in the first freshness of feeling &amp; with perfect ease &amp; unrestraint are more effervescent &amp; sparkling as well as more just than any thing I am likely to write now with the fear of the Public before my eyes. For instance I want to write an essay on <persName ref="#Austen_Jane">Miss Austen</persName>'s novels, which are by no means valued <del rend="squiggles" unit="chars" n="1"/>as they deserve--indeed are never mentioned or thought of amongst good writers--&amp; I am sure I should find better materials in my letters to you written just after I read them than I should be able to compound<del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1"/>from my own recollection. Of course I am not going to print them in the form of letters or to have any allusion to names or persons.  All that I intend is to select any happy expressions (if I chance to find any)--or any vivid descriptions--<del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1"/> to steal from myself, as it were; &amp; if you my dear <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William,</persName> will condescend to be an accessory before the fact in this petty larceny, I shall be most obliged to you.  You can bring the letters with you, for I shall depend on seeing you in our smoky den though I am rather ashamed of its dirt &amp; dinginess--(I <pb n="3"/>mean to send <persName ref="#Russell_M">Mama</persName> off to <placeName ref="#Winchester_city">Winchester</placeName>, (She can't bear paint,) &amp; to have it whitened &amp; tidied up this summer)--but you must let us have a sight of you, for my going to <placeName ref="#London_city">Town</placeName> is very uncertain--It depends on my <title ref="#Fiesco_play">Play</title>, &amp; I have no hopes of its being accepted--&amp; when I give myself a few days holidays it will probably be later in the year, &amp; my head quarters will be <placeName ref="#Richmond">Richmond</placeName><placeName ref="#Twickenham">Twickenham</placeName><placeName ref="#Kew_village">Kew</placeName>--I have many friends in those parts--to say nothing of <persName ref="#James_Miss">Miss James</persName>--so you must come, just to satisfy yourself that I am fatter &amp; rosier than than ever in spite of my quill driving, &amp; as gay as a lark my tragedies notwithstanding.--What you say about <title ref="#Kenilworth_WS">Kenilworth</title> &amp; about <title>Curiosity</title> is very just &amp; true--but if the catastrophe were offered a thousand times over it would not alter the powerful impression made on my mind my such a dissection of the wicked human heart.--Have you read <persName ref="#Nicholls_John">Mr. Nicholl</persName>'s <title ref="#Recoll_Reign_GeoIII">Recollections of the Reign of George the Third</title> (I am not sure that this is the title) It seems to me the most extraordinary isntance of fairness &amp; impartiality in an old party man that I ever met with &amp; is amusing to boot.  To be sure if <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1"/>a man of 76 &amp; stone blind, be not impartial one does not know where to look for that rare quality.  Of course you won't disagree with him in many points--so do I--but the general rightmindedness is astonishing.--<persName ref="#Haydon">Mr. Haydon</persName> &amp; his bright eyes are at <placeName ref="#Glasgow">Glasgow</placeName>--His money ?? [lender?] was very ill--dying--So he was forced to set off at a day's warning to take care of his concerns there--leaving <title ref="#Lazarus_Haydon">the Resurrection of Lazarus</title> to take care of itself. He has painted down to the arms in the figure of Christ in that picture--which is a great improvement in industry &amp; dispatch.--What a terrible affair this duel is! What a pity that poor <persName ref="#Scott_John">John Scott</persName> did not at once fight <persName ref="#Lockhart_JG">Mr. Lockhart</persName>. <persName ref="#Smith_Horace">Horace Smith</persName> for his second, or which would have been better still <add place="above">will</add> say simply that he would not fight at all in a literary quarrel. He is now the Victim of his own contemptible second--a man who [is-- missing?]a pawnbroker on Ludgate Hill &amp; a dandy in St. James's Street--&amp;who egged <pb n="4"/> on his unhappy friend to gratify his own trumpery desire of notoriety.  I hope he will be severely dealt with.--Thinking of hanging--we are all talking here of a neighbour of ours a <persName>rich farmer's widow</persName> who seems likely enough to be in that predicament. She has set fire to her premises to cheat the Insurance office--but if she has sense enough to plead lunacy I think she may escape. I must tell you one story of her. <persName>Her husband</persName> died about three months ago &amp; desired to be buried at <placeName ref="#Chippenham">Chippenham</placeName>--his native place.  The disconsolate Widow mourned over the expence of a <choice><sic>Herse</sic><reg resp="#lmw">hearse</reg></choice> thought it would be much cheaper to send the body by the stage &amp; set off to <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> to <choice><sic>negociate</sic><reg resp="#lmw">negotiate</reg></choice> for the carriage of the Corpse. <q>"Carry a coffin on the outside of the Coach Ma'am! Its impossible."</q> quoth the astonished Coachman. <q>"Well never mind the Coffin"</q> continued this persevering Economist <q>"Can I pack him up some other way?"</q><metamark rend="waves"/> The <persName> owner of our old place</persName><!-- Elliott?  LMW --> is farming it <del rend="squiggles"/> topsy turvy--he has filled up the water &amp; is going to cut down the firs--besides unheard of vagaries in the House--without he is spending two or three thousand pounds in spoiling the place, if ever he should be tried for his life I will give him as good a character for being mad--as I would to the aforesaid. I must tell you a story of him. He is a soft youth of good fortune &amp; no education, &amp; being in love with a <persName>young woman</persName>, a clergyman's daughter contrived in pure mistake (it must have been mistake for they had neither of them any fortune) to marry her <persName>Aunt</persName>.  Last summer the Aunt died, &amp; he out of gratitude I suppose for the release had a sort of royal funeral which cost eight or nine hundred pounds--the defunct lying in state, in such a cottage as this--&amp; with no mortal to see her but himself &amp; the Maid.  he is now going to marry his first love the niece--you know a similar accident befel <persName>Lord Portsmouth</persName>--who after he had been married two months to his present wife found out that he had intended to marry her sister.</p><addrLine>To <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William Elford Bar<hi rend="superscript">t</hi></persName></addrLine><addrLine><placeName ref="#Bickham_village">Bickham</placeName></addrLine><addrLine><placeName ref="#Plymouth_city">Plymouth</placeName></addrLine><addressLine>single</addressLine></div></body><div><back>
