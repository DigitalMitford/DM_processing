              <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary.

            <p>Your kind letter gave all the pleasure that your good nature could desire--It is a
               great comfort to know that my trifles have, some of them at least, a chance of being
               accepted, &amp; it is no less a one that <rs type="title" ref="#Fiesco_MRMplay">my
                  Tragedy</rs> is not yet rejected. I enclose a good for nothing essay for <persName ref="#Colburn">Mr Colburn</persName>.<!--scw: 6/12/17: Thought I'd identified this "good for nothing" but can't be certain. Journal mentions she's working on an Essay on Letters (I do not know what this is), and an Essay on Thomas May (confirmed published). Both are possible, though Essay on Thomas May could have been sent to Talfourd earlier in March, since she mentions it in Journal before a large packet of stuff sent to Talfourd on 16 March. So likely not part of this letter. --> I have nearly finished another little Drama for
                  <persName ref="#Baldwin_R">Mr Baldwin</persName>--You will wonder at my loading
               you with so many of these slight Sketches, but I wish to accumulate a little stock of
               them that if a series should be inserted in the <rs type="title" ref="#LondonMag">Magazine</rs> I may not be interrupted when I begin another Tragedy,<note resp="#scw">The tragedy that <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> subsequently
                  began was <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">Foscari</title>.</note> which I shall
               certainly do as soon as I hear that <title ref="#Fiesco_MRMplay">Fiesco</title> is

                  <!--LMW: I think she refers to one or more of the dramatic sketches here, some of which came out first in magazines. The journal gives some details on which ones she is writing (see part 4) The first one to come out was I think Emily.--><!--SCW, 6/10/17 TO LMW: Thanks, and check my notes following. Pretty sure the Dramatic Sketches are Emily and Claudia's Dream, based on the Journal--><note resp="#scw">Mitford is likely referring to <title ref="#Emily_DS">Emily</title>.

                     3</date>. She mentions beginning another sketch on <date when="1821-04-12">April 12</date>, and records finishing a sketch on <date when="1821-04-21">April 21 </date>, which indicates the rapid pace at which she was composing

            <p>You will find a copy of the Sonnet<note resp="#lmw">This is the sonnet <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> wrote on

               of its object I certainly never expected that you would send that sonnet to either
               Magazine<!--LMW I wonder what the second magazine was?--><!--SCW: Thanks for this identification and note! The way I read the foregoing passage, Talfourd did not send the sonnet anywhere, but could have sent it to either the New Monthly or the London had he been inclined, despite the past tense that suggests he did send to both? In any case, should the mags be noted, do you think?-->--to

                  lawyer who made his name during the Treason Trials, who became a judge and later a
                  Member of Parliament who helped shape the rules of evidence and the modern
                  adversarial
               system.</note><!--LMW: maybe we don't need the note, if we have the tags?--><!--SCW TO LMW: Good point. I think I'd rather signal uncertainty about the reference. In that spirit, I've left the xml:id and info in the <back> for harvesting, but have not tagged him here. I don't like the idea of tagging him if the reference is uncertain, but a speculative in-text note is ok, imo. So, if William Garrow turns up again in this project, he'll have an xml:id ready to go.:-) Or am I off-base in my thinking? Open to re-thinking.-->and
               besides I would not for the world make that which was a mere relief to my own
               feelings an object of barter--No! that sonnet shall never be printed for money--but
               would you dislike if sometime hence--not for a long while--it should slip, nobody
               knows how, into the <title ref="#LondonMag">London Magazine</title>? If you should
               dislike it you must tell me so. If not I could send it to <persName ref="#Haydon">Mr

               commission--It would be a nice little job for him--but not just now for he is very
               angry and with reason at the unprovoked attack that one of <persName ref="#Baldwin_R">Mr Baldwin</persName>'s writers has made on his character. I cannot imagine how
               anything so malicious could creep into so respectable a publication. <note resp="#scw">It is difficult to tell with certainty which article <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> may be referring to here. The long friendship
