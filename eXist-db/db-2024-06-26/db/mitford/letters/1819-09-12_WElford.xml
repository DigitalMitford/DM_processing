Probably a different hand from Mitford's that marks many of her letters, sometimes drawing diagonal lines across pages, and sometimes writing words overtop and perpendicularly across Mitford's writing. A red line is drawn from top left to bottom right of each of the first six leaves. A phrase is struck out in red crayon on page two.

         <p>About fifty times I determined, my dear Sir William, to sustain my epistolary dignity &amp; never be betrayed into writing you three letters to one. But it is in vain--the more I resolve the less I execute--especially when the resolution is a sort of unnatural holding one’s tongue--So consoling myself with the sophistry that the letter which crossed yours cannot count for a bona fide letter--only a sort of a sidewind-- &amp; that I have only sent one epistle since--I write. My motive is partly a desire to prattle--partly a desire to hear--mostly the last.--First of all you must condole with me. I have lost my poor Mossy. He died about a fortnight ago of a fit, exceedingly lamented by every body about the place &amp; most of all by me--the faithfullest &amp; most intelligent creature in the world &amp; fonder of me than anything in it except just Papa &amp; Mama. Are not you very sorry for poor Mossy? I remember so well your feeding him &amp; how well he understood when he was to take the meat. I am sure you will be sorry for poor Mossy. He was only 6 years old &amp; had eaten a hearty breakfast just the day he died--but though so large &amp; strong looking a dog he had never been healthy.--Then you must tell me that you have forgiven one breach of promise--I assure you if I have not been to Bickham I have been no where else--scarcely out of our own gates--but sitting under the trees all day long reading, working, &amp; taming <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1"/><add resp="#lmw">by</add> half the redbreasts &amp; black birds in the neighborhood--a very lazy very happy life. Then when you have condoled &amp; pardoned you may say what you will--any thing--or nothing--no not nothing English--nothing French--<foreign xml:lang="fr">des riens</foreign>--they make the best letters of any thing of my acquaintance as witness Madame de Sevigne--Horace Walpole &amp; Sir William Elford. <pb n="2" facs="P1020279"/>Mrs. Dickinson is come home quite delighted with your Camilla criticism <del rend="strikethrough" unit="word" n="4" resp="rc">which is indeed admirable</del>--I have promised to show her that on the Bride of Lammermoor which she admires for those precise qualities which you &amp; I call faults! She won’t be converted--but she will think it very clever (your critique I mean) nevertheless. The Legend of Montrose she did not much like in spite of Captain Dalgetty. By the way did I ever <del rend="strikethrough" resp="penAnnotRCL" unit="word" n="5">say to you that which</del><add place="above" resp="penAnnotRCL">mention what</add> strikes me so much in reading that &amp; some other of Scott’s Characters--that he is a greater favorite with the Author than he pretends--that he makes believe to decry &amp; undervalue him just by a species of allowable coquetry to gain more surely the hearts of his readers. Shakespeare I think does that with some of his finest &amp; most intellectual characters--Falstaff, Shylock, Richard--&amp; the reaction is felt even by those who do not observe the artifice. Perhaps this is only a fancy of mine--but I have it--&amp; where <metamark rend="caret" place="below"/><add place="above">is</add> that fancy which I do not tell you?--Oh I have been reading Opie’s Lectures--Indeed Dr. Valpy having a spare copy gave them to me--a very valuable gift in my opinion. Nothing can <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1">give</del><add place="above">be</add>be a juster character than your phrase, <q>There is no standing still in them</q><!--LMW: I think the comma and the quotation marks are added by penAnnotRCL, not Mitford. How/if to tag?-->--all is clear sparkling running water--no weeds, no scum, no mud. They give me a much higher idea of his powers than his paintings--or rather having constantly before my eyes a coarse &amp; unpleasant specimen of his portraits I had allowed myself to be prejudiced against him-- naturally perhaps but certainly unfairly.<add resp="penAnnotRCL"><metamark rend="asterisk"/></add><!--LMW: This is the symbol similar to the Japanese reference mark or asterisk: ※ See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Japanese_typographic_symbols#Other_special_marks.-->  The lectures are very powerful--they have not Fuseli’s Italian Imagination, but they make up for that deficiency by a great fund of English good sense. I do not like them the less because they contradict Fuseli in the very points which made me stare so much. A great proof that Mr. Opie is right. Don’t you think so?-- Pray have you read Evelyn’s Memoirs? If not do. Begin forthwith--&amp; do not shrug of your shoulders or look askew at the<add resp="penAnnotRCL"><metamark rend="asterisk"/>It was a very fine picture of Dr. Mitford &amp; the likeness to the truth was too strong to satisfy the ideal view which the daughter took of his Manners &amp; character</add>
            
            <pb n="3" facs="P1020282.JPG"/> bulk of the Volumes--they are as entertaining as they are thick.--I cannot give them a higher character. Perhaps I like them the better for the portion of history that they embrace--The reign of the Stuarts from Charles the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> to the Revolution has always been the part of English story that has had most attractions in my eyes--After the Revolution all is as dull &amp; flat as a novel when the hero &amp; heroine are married, &amp; I would as soon read the long accounts of Miss Byron’s wedding dresses &amp; Sir Charles Grandison’s furniture, as the petty squabbles of William &amp; Mary &amp; Anne &amp; the Georges--Now Evelyn not only gives you all the finest part of this grand fifty years drama but shows the Actors behind the scenes--off the stage--with their wigs thrown by &amp; their hoops off--You meet them at dinner parties &amp; at plays the Buckinghams, the Shaftesburys the Arlingtons the Clarendons--all the cabal-- you talk with the King &amp; the Duke by land &amp; by water--let houses to the Czar Peter &amp; show gardens to the Russells &amp; the Sidneys--All the <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="3">personages of the</del>dramatis personae of the the Memoires de Grammont are before you &amp; half the heroes of the State trials. Nothing can be more delightful--there are some charming letters too from that unlucky personage the Queen of Bohemia--whose adhorrence of the K &amp; Queen of Sweden (Christian) is exceedingly dramatic &amp; entertaining &amp; a correspondence between Lord Clarendon <metamark rend="caret" place="below"/><add place="above">when only Sir Edward Hyde</add> &amp; Sir Richard Browne his Majesty's resident at Paris which puts the poverty of that ambulating court in the strongest point of view possible--Only think of the Chancellor's sending the Preisdent a Pistole to pay the postage of his letters--&amp; begging the Resident who had been lucky enough to light upon some wire to pay the Carriage or he should not be able to take it in. Nothing as I said before can be more delightful. Pray read it. Then I have been reading about the same people in a fine lordly book--Lord John Russell's Life of Lord Russell. Don't <pb n="3" facs="P1020284.JPG"/> read that. Its prodigiously heavy indeed--it does nothing but stand still--it quarrels--it turns up its nose--it says How good I am to tell you all this--you <metamark rend="caret" place="below"/> never forget that its by a Lord &amp; about a Lord all the way through--that I must say though he is my Cousin.--Now Bishop Burnet tells the very same story &amp; he makes it interesting--but between Bishop Burnet's Book &amp; Lord John's there is much the same difference as between the old Lord Russell alive with his head on, &amp; the said Lord Russell dead with his head off.--It's a great mercy that Lord John when he was about it did not take Algernon Sidney in hand--That would have overset my patience entirely--Instead of the cousinly &amp; civil manner in which I have spoken of him above I should I am afraid have said something disrespectful &amp; saucy--for Algernon Sidney is my hero of Heroes, the only rival of Napoleon in my heart, &amp; millions of miles above Lord Russell--whom (to confess the truth--as a great secret &amp; quite in a corner) I cannot help thinking a good deal over-rated. He was a very good man to be sure--too good by fifty times--though abundantly heavy &amp; preachy &amp; prosy--&amp; but for his excellent luck in being beheaded in such a cause might have lived &amp; died without the slightest risk of pitching in any rhyme but a dedication or an Epitaph. And (as a still greater secret--in a still lower voice &amp; closer squeezed into the corner) my opinion of his wife is pretty much the same--She was a very good wife to be sure &amp; a good Mother--though rather addicted to match making &amp; Bishop-making--&amp; putting me in mind perpetually of Buckingham's presentation of Richard to the Mayor &amp; Alderman <!--LMW:  quotation marks added by Annotator?--><q>See where his Grace stands twixt two Clergymen</q>--but to talk of her as such a miracle of talent &amp; character--to place her on the same line with the Mrs. Hutchesons the Lady Fairfax's the Madame Rolands is an injustice of praise for which I can only account by the violent prejudices of party Historians who will have Angels &amp; Devils for their personages instead of Men &amp; Women.--Pray don't tell. <add resp="rc">)</add><pb n="4" facs="P1020285.JPG"/>But even more than Evelyn I must recommend to you a book that I have just finished--Peter's letters to his Kinsfolk--Have you read it? It is a fictitious account of real people &amp; those people are all the celebrated men of the Northern Athens vulgarly called Edinburgh. The book is charming--so are the people--James Hogg I am in love with--(I always was in love with his poetry)--&amp; I am little less with John Wilson--though his verses are not so much to my taste--Mr. Jeffrey is very taking too--In short I read the book twice over &amp; should like exceedingly to read it again. The Author is a great craniologist &amp; makes a very artistlike &amp; graphical use of this unknown knowledge. He is also a great Tory which you will like &amp; a great Wordsworthite which you will dislike--but altogether I defy you not to be pleased.--The accounts of the great advocates are admirable particularly Mr. Clark <metamark rend="caret" place="below" resp="penAnnotRCL"/><add place="above">mr Jeffrey <metamark rend="cross"/></add><!--more added here then lined out by annotator.--> Mr. Jeffrey Mr. Cranstoun--(Is he a brother of your Correspondent?) One quite wonders at the power which has given such an air of reality &amp; <!-- squiggles --> identity to such high coloured panegyric--for he scarcely mentions any one but to praise except poor old Lord Buchan--&amp; yet one is scarcely every tempted to suspect him of flattery. I liked it <!--del--> the better for my old acquaintance with Blackwood's Magazine for which in spite of its toryism &amp; its sauciness I have had all along a sneaking kindness. Do read Peter. By the way I wonder very much who he is! Tell me if you hear. Now I will positively plague you no more about books.--<!--waves--> The Hofland's splendid publication (that can't be called a book for the engravings are the soul of that grand work) is out at last--&amp; they are in great luck not to have got many subscribers for the booksellers have agreed to take them at 7 guineas a copy <pb n="5" facs="P1020289.JPG"/> don't like the sight of one.</p>
         <p>Adieu my dear Friend!--I shall not send this till Wednesday when owing to a grand music meeting at Reading there will be a great influx of Lords &amp; M.P.s.

            <p>Wednesday night. No letter to answer yet! Naughty man! as some one of Mr. Richardson's heroines is wont to say--Naughty Man!--which was it used to say so? Miss Howe? or Lady G? I can't remember--but the word is a good one--&amp; seems made on purpose to be applied to the very best correspondent in the world--the best letter writer I mean--when he takes a fit of laziness &amp; <emph rend="underline">Lotos his pen</emph>--Naughty Man--have you read the last that is <!--torn--> third Volume of Nicholl's Literary History of the last Cent<gap reason="torn" unit="chars" n="3"/><supplied resp="lmw">ury</supplied>--I am reading it now--not finished--but very much amused especially with the Hardinge Part of the Miscellany--That Mrs. George Hardinge seems to have been a singularly strange character for a eminent judge--a Boswellish sort of a person--full of good humour &amp; animal spirits &amp; self importance &amp; vanity &amp; flattery &amp; vivacious detail--a sort of person to jump &amp; sing when other men would walk &amp; talk--some of his letters very very entertaining indeed particularly the letters Royal. The account of the Duke of Kent's establishment at Castle Hill is the best &amp; most amusing way of accounting for his debts that I have met with--I had a very high opinion of the Duke of Kent &amp; I am really quite sorry (as sorry as one can be for a thing one laughs at) to find him guilty of so much solemn frivolity.--You will guess that I mean to recommend Mr. Nicholl's Melange--so I do--with much skipping will be<pb n="6" facs="P1020292.JPG"/> understood--for just now I am stranded amongst a shoal of<metamark rend="caret" place="below"/><add place="above">the illustrious <unclear/></add>--dull acquaintances <metamark rend="caret" place="below"/><add place="above">&amp; such small dogs</add> whose own trumpery letters are become Antiques--deuce take the Good Bodies--they hurt me not for I skip--The book is a good book notwithstanding--there is a delicious little bit of Lord Stanhope's charming madness--&amp; a good deal of Bishop Watson's matchless egotism--&amp; one or two morsels of Horace Walpole. By the bye have you read his letters to Mr. Montagu &amp; Mrs. Cole?--Good bye--I remember I promised you to talk no more of books this time--but you are used to my breach of promise in this way--&amp; mind it no mo<gap reason="torn" unit="chars" n="2"/><supplied resp="lmw">re</supplied> than an eel does skinning--This letter looks prodigiously like the literary article in some third rate magazine--the article called notices of new publications stuck in the midst of deaths, thunderstorms, &amp; <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1"/> patients lately enrolled.--forgive the fine stitched double<!--??--> nonsense a literary air.--I say this because I am sure you will think it--Adieu--I hope all your family are well &amp; Miss Welsford proceeding in her case--God bless you.</p>
