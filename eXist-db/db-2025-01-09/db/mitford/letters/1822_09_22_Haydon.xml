Postscripts do NOT go inside closer tags. Adjust to take into account the order in your letter. Sometimes the signature is on page three, the address on page four, then the postscript follows back on the top of page one, for example.-->
            
             <closer><!--Use the <closer> element again to hold Address Leaf information, indicating where Mitford directed her letter.-->
               <address> <!--Include any text written on the address leaf; use a separate "addrLine" for each line and indicate line breaks. Closer tags must also enclose the address section. NOTE AGAIN: If Mitford has a postscript, that postcript must *not* be enclosed in the closer tags, even when they are written after the signature and before the address. It's a TEI rule (sigh). -->
            <addrLine><!--Text of a line on the address leaf, with context coding and superscripts indicated. For example: To T. N. Talfourd--></addrLine>
                  <addrLine><!--Text of a line on the address leaf, with context coding and superscripts indicated. For example: No. 1 Pump Court--></addrLine>
                  <addrLine><!--Text of a line on the address leaf, with context coding and superscripts indicated. For example: Temple--></addrLine>
                  <!--Some address leaves may have a name and city in the bottom left; this indicates the person who franked the letter, usually a Member of Parliament whom Mitford knows. Tag as an additional address line. For example: <persName ref="#Monck_JB">J. B. Monck</persName> <placeName ref="#Plymouth_city">Plymouth</placeName>-->
