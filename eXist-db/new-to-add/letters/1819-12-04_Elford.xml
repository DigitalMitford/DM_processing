            <p>Your kind entertaining letter my dear <rs type="person" ref="#Elford_SirWm">Friend</rs> &amp; its very curious and amusing Enclosure (which I re-enclose) <add place="above">X <note resp="#penAnnot_RCL">8 <hi rend="underline">Note</hi><lb/>X This Enclosure was a MS. Journal <unclear/> <persName ref="#Ashburton_Lord">Lord Ashburton</persName>.</note></add> have given me great pleasure. <persName ref="#Ashburton_Lord">Lord Ashburton</persName>'s descriptions are delightful chiefly from the extreme &amp; singular honesty with which he sacrifices all effect &amp; fine writing to the desire of placing the exact &amp; naked truth before his Correspondent--a sacrifice which like most other meritorious self denials, is repaid a thousandfold by the freshness of spirit which this absence of commonplace finery throws <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1"/> over the subject. His naïveté too is quite charming--just such as a highly gifted Author can sometimes bestow on a fictitious character but which very few Authors indeed can boast themselves. I hope the Public will see the Journal--a selection at least--not an abridgement--<foreign xml:lang="fr">En attendant</foreign> I have transcibred his letter, which made me fully conscious of its length (one does not feel that it is long in reading) &amp; of the peculiar power of compressing words &amp; letters which his Lordship possesses--a power which I believed passed away with my Maternal Grandfather <persName ref="#Russell_Rich">Dr. Russell</persName>--who at the age of Eighty eight wrote a hand quite as small as firm as ever &amp; as legible as <persName ref="#Ashburton_Lord">Lord Ashburton</persName>'s--Is <persName>Lady A.</persName> so fat &amp; so pretty as he describes? And is he himself as agreeable as his letter would indicate? And is your friend <persName>Mr. Cranstoun</persName> related to the celebrated Edinburgh Advocate &amp; Whig? (Observe how nicely this word Whig leads me on to Politics without having recourse to any wicked hieroglyphical jerks such as a certain friend of mine is wont to use!)--You ask me two questions &amp; tell me not to answer them--but I shall answer them--one at least to your satisfaction. With all possible regard for the private character of <persName>Lord Fitzwilliam</persName>, I am quite of your opinion, respecting his dismissal--&amp;<pb n="2"/> have always considered it as a fine &amp; striking piece of Poetical Justice--As to the Legality of the meeting at Manchester--hem--I really don't know what to say of the matter--our speechifying Lawyers here in the Country were very positive on the subject--but as their betters &amp; Wisers &amp; Learneders in London seem to demur--I think it safest to demur too.--In fact I cannot help having a small private suspicion that the meeting must have been illegal or some of the many great Whig Lawyers in Parliament would certainly have hazarded a contrary opinion--but granting that, I still think it illegally suppresssed. We are <hi rend="underline">one</hi> step nearer now my dear Friend but only one, so I will talk no more of the matter.</p><metamark rend="jerks"/><p>I thought you would laugh at the <persName ref="#Haydon">Haydon</persName> story--It is a real misfortune for one person with some pretensions to celebrity to have a name similar in sound to one rendered very famous by another--But he will have a good deal of fame of his own when <title>the Picture</title> is exhibited--Fame of all sorts Praise &amp; Blame--both of which he will welcome as tokens of celebrity &amp; pegs to hang Answers on! I am pretty sure in spite of the ominous "almost" that the Painting will be finished this Spring, because the great difficulty the Head of Christ is at length overcome--The present Head is the seventh he has painted! one of them was taken from himself! which seems to me quite as good a <!-- trait?? --> as the Birthday--for though his Countenance be very intellectual &amp; full of spirit &amp; ardency, it is I think one of the very last human faces that any body but the owner would think of copying for Jesus Christ. (Pray don't tell the story <add rend="carat" place="below"/><add place="above">of the Head</add>--which <persName ref="#Hofland_TC">Mr. Hofland</persName> told me--&amp; which might set our two fiery Artists in a flame.) You, whose poetical faith is I believe rather Pope-<hi rend="underline">ish</hi>, would have liked to see a Portrait of Pope which <persName ref="#Hofland_B">Mrs. Hofland</persName> says they have just had in the house--<q>"taken very young an undoubted original by <persName>Jarvis</persName>; a sweeter expression, a more intelligent countenance cannot be conceived; no unholy or selfish feeling has yet ruffled the soft serenity of the brow which even Dr. <!-- Morris? --><pb n="3"/> of <placeName><choice><sic>Aberystwith</sic><reg>Aberystwyth</reg></choice></placeName> would allow to be wide enough &amp; high enough for a Poet</q>--Should not you have discovered this not to be my writing even if I had omitted the inverted commas by the continuity of the style, the absence of that perpetual hopping motion which distinguishes mine?--Now that I am transcribing other people's letters I will copy for you a passage from one of <persName ref="#Haydon">Mr. Haydon</persName>'s (poor dear man! really it's a shame to laugh at him!) written (to thank us for a hare) from <persName>Mr. Wilkie</persName>s house at <placeName ref="#Kensington">Kensington</placeName>. <q>"<persName>Wilkie</persName> is painting a capital picture of reading the will. <!-- David Wilkie, "Reading of a Will" exhibited 1821. -->At a table is an old lawyer's clerk, a sort of mean looking narrow featured rascal who holds the will with all its awful appendages of seals &amp; reads it with that cant twang which all people have in their voice when they are doing what they have done often &amp; habit has rendered them insensible either to the importance or interest of what they do.--To the left sits the widow--a large enbonpoint lady with her arm stretched out on the favorite arm chair of her late dear Spouse holding a handkerchief &amp; by her expression of feature seeming not at all displeased at which she hears read, or at what either she hears said by a bald pated half pay Officer who leans down to her cheek &amp; in an affected air of condolence is certainly whispering something in the Widows Ear which perhaps prevents her despairing of a future conquest should so shocking an idea enter her afflicted head. To the right, or rather in the center stands a sort of middle aged Grandmother holding the infant in her arms &amp; erecting her head with an <del rend="squiggles" type="word" n="3">gleeful Turkey-cock chuckle</del>air of proud insolent ecstasy at what has been read by the Clerk which makes it freely clear that her part of the family are safe, her air, figure, look &amp; expression are quite admirable, they dilate into a kind of turkeycock chuckle &amp; capitally contrast with a furious old maid at the door who has snatched up her cane at the instant &amp; is sarcastically sneering at the whole company, as she hurries away in<pb n="4"/> indignation at being cut perhaps with ten pounds for a ring. These are the principal points in this admirable picture, which will be out in the Spring--there are other characters in it equally excellent, such as an old man with an ear trumpet, a servant boy &amp; others which keep up the chain of interest. It is for the King of Bavaria and will not be engraved here."</q> Now this is exceedingly clever &amp; pleasant, as all he writes &amp; says is when he does not put himself in a passion--By the way the room he has taken is in Piccadilly &amp; I believe all his Pictures are to be exhibited</p><metamark rend="jerks"/><p>--I quite agree with you respecting <title>Discipline</title>--there is no word but Methodism that can express the impression intended to be conveyed--&amp; that impression spoils it. The end too is miserably lame, the cause of which is explained by <persName ref="#Brunton_Alexander">Dr. Brunton</persName> in <persName ref="#Brunton_Mary">Mrs. B.</persName>'s life to be the appearance of <title ref="#Waverley">Waverley</title>, which took away all the originality of her highland pictures &amp; dispirited &amp; overwhelmed her by its infinite superiority--<persName ref="#Brunton_Mary">Mrs. Brunton</persName> herself was not at all like a Methodist--she had none of the smoothness the sadness &amp; the cant of those wretched looking people--on the contrary she was exceedingly lively bouncing &amp; abrupt--with great talents undoubtedly &amp; a power of strong eloquent writing very rare in a woman. I have just been looking over a book which puts Methodism in the strongest point of view of any I ever met with--unintentionally for it is an Evangelical book, of the highest class &amp; reputation--splendidly printed &amp; widely circulated--<title>The Memoirs of the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> H. Martyn</title>. Did you ever hear of him? He was a Cornish young man, who gained the highest honours at <orgName ref="#Cambridge_Univ">Cambridge</orgName>, but falling into the clutches of <persName>Mr. C. Simeon</persName> &amp; his sect relinquished all his hopes &amp; prospects in <placeName ref="#England">England</placeName> &amp; went as a Missionary to <placeName ref="#India">India</placeName> where he died.--This book is chiefly a selection from his journals, &amp; the shocking familiarity with which he addresses the <pb n="5"/><persName>Diety</persName>--the horrible manner in which he consigns all who differ from him to eternal punishment--&amp; above all the strain of constant fear doubt &amp; agony in which he describes his own mind, are such as no Imagination could have conceived. In the whole thick &amp; closely printed Octavo Volume there is not one page uncontaminated by such expressions of personal fondness towards the <persName ref="#Jesus">Saviour</persName> as a lover would scarcely use towards his Mistress or a Mother to her babe--&amp; with such declarations of wickedness remorse &amp; misery as would seem exaggerated from a Murderer. If I had any friend likely to fall into Methodism (any friend of common sense I mean in such danger) I should certainly recommend these Memoirs as an Antidote--the very dose which the Methodists themselves would prescribe for a <!--torn inserted: contrary --> purpose. If it were possible to laugh at <add place="above">such a history, now</add> the book would be ridiculous &amp; entertaining <add>enough--We</add> are very sorry to hear of <persName ref="Elford_Jonathan">Mr. Elford</persName>'s illness.
