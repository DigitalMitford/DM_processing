         <handNotes>
            <handNote corresp="#rc" medium="red_crayon"> Red crayon or thick red pencil. Probably a different hand from Mitford's that marks many of her letters, sometimes drawing diagonal lines across pages, and sometimes writing words overtop and perpendicularly across Mitford's writing. A red line is drawn from top left to bottom right of each of the first five leaves as well as leaves seven through nine. On leave six and ten, a red line is drawn from top left to bottom right across each of the text blocks. There is no red crayon across the address text block.</handNote>
            <handNote corresp="#pencil" medium="pencil"> Someone, apparently other than Mitford, perhaps cataloging letters and describing them, who left grey pencil marks and numbered her letters now in the Reading Central Library's collection. This letter is numbered "2" in the top left of the first leaf. Also numbered 1820 on the top of the fifth leaf.

            <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

            <p>I have just this moment received your most kind &amp; entertaining letter, <rs type="person" ref="#Elford_SirWm">my dear friend</rs>, &amp; I hasten to answer it on the full gallop that I may catch our flying M.P. <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Mr Fyshe Palmer</persName>--who was in <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> yesterday &amp; <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" quantity="1"></del><damage rend="smudge"/><unclear><supplied>our</supplied></unclear> (Deuce take that blot--more haste worse speed!) our moveable <rs type="person" ref="#Palmer_CF">Member</rs> who was in <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> yesterday &amp; <emph rend="underline">therefore</emph> will not be there tomorrow. First let me express how unfeignedly sorry I am--we are--for the sickness you have had to encounter at <placeName ref="#Bickham_village">Bickham</placeName>--I hope this will find your <persName>daughter</persName><note resp="#lmw"><persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Elford had two daughters; it is unclear to which she refers.</persName></note> recovering both her strength &amp; her looks--&amp; that your cough will disappear in this mild weather--melt &amp; go off like the snow. <rs type="person" ref="#Russell_M">Mama</rs> &amp; I have kept quite well this unhealthy winter--<rs type="person" ref="#Mitford_Geo">Papa</rs> has not--he has had a great deal of <choice><sic>head ach</sic><reg resp="#scw">headache</reg></choice> &amp; heavy cold--&amp; as he takes no manner of care of himself--comes down from <placeName ref="#London_city">London</placeName> at <time>four <sic>oclock</sic><corr>o'clock</corr></time> in the morning on the outside of a coach--&amp; other tendencies of the same nature (I hope he is looking over my shoulder) can scarcely expect to be free from complaint. <persName ref="#Dickinson_Mrs">Mrs. Dickinson</persName> is not yet confined &amp; keeps pretty well as to health though a good deal troubled with superstitious forebodings which I do all in my power to drive out of her head by gayer nonsense. Now you have our bulletin all round.</p><metamark rend="jerk"/><p>What you say of <title ref="#Ivanhoe">Ivanhoe</title> is admirably just and true--<persName ref="#Rowena_WS">Rowena</persName> is a mere woman of straw--a peg to hang <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/><unclear/></del>love upon--as almost all <rs type="person" ref="#Scott_Wal">his</rs> heroines are--of that horrible old woman I had before made dishonourable mention--&amp; those two scenes of burning &amp; of torture are quite unworthy of so great a Poet--He picked up that love of representing bodily suffering though, where<pb n="2"/> he got many a better thing, among the old Dramatists--they are sad bloody people those <persName ref="#Webster_John">Webster</persName>s &amp; <persName ref="#Marlowe_Chris">Marlowe</persName>s &amp; <persName ref="#Ford_John">Ford</persName>s &amp; <persName ref="#Massinger_Phil">Massinger</persName>s! And he sacrifices every thing to strong impression--as you well know--but it is terribly disgusting--&amp; the worst of it is that even his bad purpose is not answered--one is shocked for a moment &amp; then one comforts oneself with reflecting that it is all a fiction &amp; takes up the book with diminished interest.--The reality of bodily suffering is necessary to produce that wonderful &amp; mysterious horror which some descriptions of torture excite--I remember being ill for a whole fortnight from reading the account of <persName ref="#Raviallac">Ravaillac</persName>'s execution--which concludes the Memoires de Sully<!--LMW: possibly: 	
Memoirs of Maximilian de Bethune, Duke of Sully : Prime Minister of Henry the Great, newly translated from the French edition of M. de L'Ecluse. To which is annexed, the trial of Francis Ravaillac, for the murder of Henry the Great. In five volumes. Edinburgh, in English; or in French.-->--&amp; I rarely take up that delightful book even now without some sense of that shuddering feeling--a passage in Mr. Evelyn's Diary <!--LMW: The Diary of John Evelyn, a gentlemanly Royalist and virtuoso of the seventeenth century, was first published in 1818 under the title Memoirs Illustrative of the Life and Writings of John Evelyn-->produced nearly the same effect on my too irritable nerves--but then it was the truth of those scenes--the knowledge--the certainty that they had occured which fixed &amp; deepened the impression. Have not you this feeling?--After all <title ref="#Ivanhoe">Ivanhoe</title>Ivanhoe is a glorious book! How exceedingly fine is the scene where <persName ref="#Rebecca_Ivanhoe">Rebecca</persName> described to the sick <persName ref="#Ivanhoe_char">Ivanhoe</persName> the process of storming the Castle! How minute &amp; honest &amp; true the circumstance of her being covered with a shield!--All other romances would have gloried in exposing her without defence--&amp; made her escape <!-- squiggle:  all --> the darts by an unnatural miracle--that scene is in the very spirit of the old Dramatists--another source of fine Poetry whih he has studied with equal success is the <!-- ?? -->--<persName ref="#Deans_Jeanie_WS">Jeanie Deans</persName>--&amp; <persName ref="#Rebecca_Ivanhoe">Rebecca</persName> both owe their eloquence to <!-- squiggle: their? added: the --> fine Orientalism of their language--&amp; their pure &amp; noble cast of character is probably derived from the same source.--By the bye are you quite sure that the Great Unknown is <persName ref="#Scott_Wal">Mr. Walter Scott</persName>? Do you quite disbelieve that there is a partner in the firm--by no means a sleeping partner <pb n="3"/> in short, are you quite incredulous as to the American brother? <persName ref="#Scott_Wal">Mr. Scott</persName>, however, (for in that name we both agree), is <!-- add: at --> least my dear Friend as yet unimitated &amp; he tell<!-- s --> you the truth.--I almost think him inimitable--he has all the faults that you ascribe to him &amp; a great many more--but there is a perpetual power of inventing new characters--a life--an individuality--a <!-- squiggle -->creativeness in his genius which is only to be met with in the great poets--<persName ref="#Homer">Homer</persName>--<persName ref="#Ariosto">Ariosto</persName>--<persName ref="#Chaucer">Chaucer</persName>--<persName ref="#Shakespeare">Shakespeare</persName>. He must be thought of as a Poet--Other Novelists delightful as they are take their seats on the prose bench of <!-- squiggle: -->Authorship--Nobody would ever be tempted to call <title ref="#Patronage_ME">Patronage</title> a Poem--&amp; by the way I do not, much as I admire her., class <persName ref="#Edgeworth_Maria">Miss Edgeworth</persName> with <persName ref="#Austen_Jane">Miss Austen</persName>--the inimitable lamented <persName ref="#Austen_Jane">Miss Austen</persName>! <persName ref="#Edgeworth_Maria">Miss Edgeworth</persName>'s books have a <emph rend="underline">Do-me-good</emph> air about them which takes away their freedom--a wildness of plot which will not let one believe in their reality--&amp; she deals too much in the factitious part of life and manners of fashionable people--so that her work will in course of time get out of date like an old head dress--a misfortune whch cannot happen to the <!-- squiggles --> poetical antiquity of <persName ref="#Scott_Wal">Mr. Scott</persName>, or the unchangeable common life of <persName ref="#Austen_Jane">Miss Austen</persName>.-- When I wrote to you last I think I had just begun <title ref="#Petrarque_deGenlis">Petrarque et Laure</title>--Don't read it.--I believe I confided to you that I was a great admirer of that famous Lover--but still one must respect him as a great restorer of learning &amp; one of the founders of his sweet <!-- add: native --> language--Now <persName ref="#deGenlis_Mme">Madame de Genlis</persName> has made up from <persName ref="#Petrarch">Petrarch</persName> a sort of male <persName ref="#Corinne_char">Corinne</persName>--a lute-playing Improvisatore who goes about haranguing &amp; declaiming in verse &amp; in prose! Now nobody can ever have read one of <persName ref="#Petrarch">Petrarch</persName>'s sonnets without being certain that by no possible charge could one line of them be <!-- added:?? --> extempore--they seem painfully written word <pb n="4"/> by word syllable by syllable--It is their <emph rend="underline">fault</emph>, that they are of all Poems the most recherchés--Moreover <persName ref="#deGenlis_Mme">Madame de Genlis</persName> makes <persName ref="#Petrarch">Petrarque</persName> out an Angel &amp; then says she is just like him! Really these French women are vain of their own vanity! Do you ever read <persName ref="#Burney_SH">Miss Burney</persName>'s novels? I mean the lesser <persName ref="#Burney_SH">Burney</persName>--not <persName ref="#Burney_F">Madame d'Arblay</persName> but her Sister whom I like better. We are reading one now--<title ref="#Country_Neighbours">Country Neighbours</title>--pretty enough I think--Faulty by millions--a heroine who is so young so wise so good so beautiful &amp; so accomplished that she makes one sick even before she saves her lover's life, an iniquity so Miss-<persName ref="#Porter_AM">Porter</persName>ish that I quite wonder at <persName ref="#Burney_SH"> Miss Burney</persName>'s lighting upon it--the plot too is exceedingly disagreeable &amp; entangled--all in a <emph rend="underline">Snarl</emph> as Cotton-spinners say, &amp; mighty difficult to undo. But eventually the book is pretty--there is some good observation in it--&amp; a sarcastic old lady whom I like exceedingly--to say nothing of a most amiable old Maid.--Well I think I have talked enough of Novels--Did you ever read a little book which has been lately reprinted <title ref="#CaptivityCaptKnox">The Captivity of Captain John Knox in the Island of Ceylon</title>? It is charming--If one did not know it to be nothing but a real true history told by the very man to whom it happened one should take it for one of the enchanting fictions of <persName ref="#Defoe_D">Defoe</persName>. Nothing but <title ref="#RobinsonCrusoe_DD">Robinson Crusoe</title> was ever so vividly real.</p><metamark rend="jerk"/><p>I thought I had done with books--but I find I have not--<persName ref="#Jonson_B">Ben Jonson</persName>'s <title ref="#Sad_Shepherd_BJ">Sad Shepherd</title> is a fragment of a Pastoral Drama said to have been left unfinished in consequence of his friend <persName ref="#Fletcher_John">Fletcher</persName>'s exquisite <title ref="#FaithfulShepherdess_JF">Faithful Shepherdess</title>--only two acts &amp; a scene remain, but they are enchanting--Not in Old <persName ref="#Jonson_B">Ben</persName>'s common Dramatic Style, so stiff &amp; artifical--but in the sweet &amp; tender manner of some of his beautiful lyrics. If finished it would have been one of the finest things in the language--the story relates to <persName ref="#Robin_Hood">Robin Hood</persName>--<choice><sic>Gammer Gurton's <pb n="3"/>Needle</sic><reg><title ref="#GammerGurton">Gammer Gurton's Needle</title></reg></choice> is quite another matter--You know that it is the oldest English Play--&amp; really it is one of the most diverting--Coarse enough to be sure but exceedingly fresh &amp; frolicsome &amp; funny &amp; not at all unintelligible--<persName ref="#James_Miss">Miss James</persName> who is <del rend="crossout" unit="word" n="2">by far</del><add place="above">one of</add> the most elegant person of my acquaintance says she likes it better than any Comedy in the language--One of the characters in it always put me in mind of <persName ref="#Edie_Ochiltree">Edie Ochiltree</persName>--not in <add place="above"><metamark function="insertion" rend="caret">his</metamark></add> supernatural capacity--<del rend="squiggle" unit="word" n="1"/>--but in his better vocation of a merry old beggar--The <title ref="#Antiquary">"Antiquary"</title> after all is my favorite of the whole set of Scotch novels--it is written with more verve--is more a pure exertion of Intellect--seems to be the favorite of the Author--&amp; above all is the least popular among the novel reading young Misses who praise is not fame. There are more faults than in any--including <persName ref="#Elspeth">Old Elspeth</persName> &amp; all the <!-- lord? --> story--as well as that incredible <persName ref="#Dousterwivel_WS">Dousterwivel</persName>--<!-- gap: but? --> still it is my favorite--Tell me is it <choice><sic>your's</sic><reg>yours</reg></choice>?</p><metamark rend="jerk"/><p><!-- gap --> You are very good to the <rs type="person" ref="#Fisher_John">Bishop of Salisbury</rs> to assign his "distractions" as a reason for his thefts--or an excuse--but did you never observe that your absent people sometimes make very good use of their absences?
