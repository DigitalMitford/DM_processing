            <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the
               end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s
               spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate
               searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both
               Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling,
               following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and
               ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

            <p>I am quite ashamed when I look at the date of your last letter, but I generally transgress <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1">the</del> against the etiquette of correspondence by writing too soon--so you must balance one offence with the other &amp; forgive me for both--you are so good that I am sure of your pardon. I have been very busy--audaciously busy--writing a tragedy. We are poor you know--When I was in Town I saw an indifferent Tragedy of which the indifferent success produced for the author <measure type="currency">three or four hundred pounds</measure>. This raised my emulation, which the splendid <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="2" unit="word"/>success of</del> reception of <title ref="#Virginius_play">Virginius</title> or <title ref="#Mirandola_play">Mirandola</title> would never have excited &amp; I began to write on the subject of <persName ref="#Fieschi_GL">Fiesco</persName> whose conspiracy against <persName ref="#Doria_Andrea">Doria</persName> is so beautifully told in <persName ref="#Robertson_William">Robertson's</persName> <title ref="#CharlesV">Charles the Fifth</title>. There is a <bibl corresp="#Fiesco_play">German tragedy</bibl> of the same name, I believe, by <persName ref="#Schiller_F">Schiller</persName>, but I have neither seen nor sought for it probably on the same principle on which <persName ref="#Fuseli_H">Mr. Fuseli</persName> avoids nature for fear that <pb n="2"/><persName ref="#Schiller_F">Schiller</persName> should <q>"find me out."</q>--It is finished--that is it was finished--but as I had unluckily slid my hero off the scene like a ghost, I am advised to write the Fifth act over again, which I shall do next week. It is terribly feeble &amp; womanish of course--wants breadth--wants passion--&amp; has nothing to redeem its faults but a little poetry &amp; some merit they say in the dialogue. I am afraid that it will not be accepted &amp; that you will never hear of it again--but I could not bear to make an attempt of the sort without confiding my many fears &amp; my few hopes to one who will I am sure sympathise with both--my anxiety on this subject is not of vanity--It is not fame or praise that I want but the power of assisting my dearest &amp; kindest <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">Father</persName>. I am in very kind &amp; <choice><sic>skilful</sic><reg>skillful</reg></choice> hands--<title ref="#Fiesco_MRMplay">Fiesco</title> is now with <persName ref="#Talfourd_Thos">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Talfourd</persName> our highly gifted Townsman--who gives me that which is most precious, Time &amp; advice &amp; criticism almost as good as <choice><sic>your's</sic><reg>yours</reg></choice> on <title ref="#Mirandola_play">Mirandola</title>. I suppose it is the etiquette <pb n="3"/>not to mention these things till they <gap reason="wax seal" unit="word" n="1"/><unclear><supplied resp="#lmw">are</supplied></unclear> actually accepted--so you will have the goodness not to speak of it.--</p> <!--kab:  I consider this long dash to be a paragraph break the same as the squiggle.-->
