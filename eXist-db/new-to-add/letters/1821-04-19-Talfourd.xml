              <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

(Later, we'll use <closer> again to hold Mitford's address on her address leaf if it's present.)

            <postscript><p><!--A postscript goes here, outside the <closer>. --></p></postscript><!--You can include a <pb/> here, or inside the postScript.--><!-- Format for postscripts.  Postscripts do NOT go insider closer tags. Adjust to take into account the order in your letter.

             <closer><!--Use the <closer> element again to hold Address Leaf information, indicating where Mitford directed her letter.-->
