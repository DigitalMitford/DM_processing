She has published in European Romantic Review, Romanticism on the Net (now RaVon), Romantic Circles, Romantic Textualities, and elsewhere. She is currently working on a monograph on Romantic-period authorship and literary celebrity. Her work on Digital Mitford thus far includes editing and coding Mitford’s “Introduction” to her collected Dramatic Works (1854), a critical memoir that recounts the author’s influences and experiences at Covent Garden and Drury Lane in the 1820s and 30s. It also includes researching Mitford’s publication history for the site’s working bibliography, particularly tracking the migration of Mitford’s stories from their first publication to their later reappearances in collections and periodicals. A Founding Editor of Digital Mitford, she and her team of student research assistants have been at work since 2013 on transcribing, coding, and researching Mitford’s letters from 1819 to the early 1820s.

This technique allows for the creation of finer and more detailed engraved images and also results in an engraving block that is more durable than those carved with the grain. Notable works of literary illustration include editions of <persName ref="#Goldsmith">Oliver Goldsmith</persName>'s The Traveller and The Deserted Village, Thomas Parnell's The Hermit, and William Somervile's The Chase. His major works as a naturalist include A History of British Birds and A General History of Quadrupeds, as well as a series of editions of Aesop's Fables.

He served as Member of Parliament for Westbury from March 10 to November 29, a seat he secured under the patronage of Sir Manasseh Masseh Lopes. At this time, Westbury was a controversial "rotten borough" whose interest Lopes had purchased from Lord Abingdon; he resigned his seat in November 1810 to Lopes. Throughout his adulthood, his father Sir William tried unsuccessfully to secure him a position within the government. He died on March 11, 1823, at his home at Uplands, Tamerton Folliott, Devon.

Lancelot Elford and Grace Alexander Wills. He was baptised in Kingsbridge on October 31, 1749. He married Mary Davies of Plympton on January 20, 1776 and they had one son, Jonathan, and two daughters, Grace Chard and Elizabeth. After the death of his first wife, he married Elizabeth Hall, widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Maine Swete Walrond of the Coldstream Guards. Elizabeth was the daughter and co-heir of Humphry Hall of Manadon, Devon, and had two children by her previous marriage, although only her son lived to adulthood. Sir William's only son Johnathan died in 1823, leaving him without an heir. He worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase) in Plymouth, Devon, from its founding in 1782. He was elected a member of Parliament for Plymouth as a supporter of the government and Tory William Pitt, and served from 1796 to 1806. After his election defeat in Plymouth in 1806, he was elected member of Parliament for Rye and served from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service in Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800; after his son Johnathan came of age, he tried to secure a government post for him but never succeeded. He served as mayor of Plymouth in 1796 and served as Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833; he was also Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer in the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of Lieutenant Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars. Sir William was a talented amateur painter in oils and watercolors who exhibited at the Royal Society from 1774 to 1837; he exhibited still lifes and portraits but preferred landscapes. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1790. He was also a talented amateur naturalist and was elected to the Royal Linnaean Society in 1790; late in life, he published his findings on an alternative to yeast. According to <persName ref="#Lestrange">L'Estrange</persName>, Elford was a friend of <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">Mitford's father</persName>, and <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> met him for the first time in the spring of 1810 when he was a widower nearing the age of 64.

The 1851 census lists her occupation as "authoress," and lists her as living at Three Mile Cross with Kerenhappuch Taylor (lady's maid), Sarah Chernk (maid-of-all-work), and Samuel Swetman (gardener), after the death of her father.

The executor of her will and her literary executor was the Rev. William Harness and her lady's maid, Kerrenhappuch Taylor Sweetman, was residuary legatee of estate.

Since he disappears from English census records after 1861, reappearing in 1891, and gives his son Arthur Harry Edmund's birthplace as Isipingo, Natal, South Africa (then a British colony), it seems possible that he emigrated to South Africa between those dates, then returned to England.

He took orders in the Church of England in 1777. Richard Valpy served as Second Master at Bury School, Bury, Huntindonshire from 1771 to 1781, and was also collated to the rectory of Stradishall, Suffolk, in 1787. He became the Headmaster at Reading School, Reading, Berkshire, in 1781 and served until 1830, at which time he turned the Headmastership over to his youngest son Francis E. J. Valpy and continued in semi-retirement until his death in 1836. During his tenure as Headmaster of <placeName ref="#Reading_School">Reading Grammar School</placeName> for boys over the course of fifty years, he expanded the boarding school and added new buildings. He is the author of numerous published works, including Greek and Latin textbooks, sermons, volumes of poetry, and adaptations of plays such as Shakespeare's King John and Sheridan's The Critic.

By the end of the 18th century, shows were performed using glove puppets on mobile puppet booths and found a home on the nineteenth century on the beaches of English seaside resorts and evolved into children's entertainments in the Victorian era. Mr. Punch is the traditional protagonist of such shows; episodic plots normally involve Punch beating his wife and other characters with his "slapstick" and end with him defeating even the Devil himself.</note><note><ref target="http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/thats-the-way-to-do-it!-a-history-of-punch-and-judy/"/></note></person><person xml:id="Pygmalion" sex="1"><persName>Pygmalion</persName><note resp="#lmw">Mitford generally refers to the version of the myth from <persName ref="#Ovid">Ovid</persName>'s <title ref="#Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</title> in which Pygmalion is a sculptor who carves a female statue out of ivory, falls in love with the statue, and Aphrodite brings the statue to life.</note></person><person xml:id="Queen_Ch1"><persName>Queen Henrietta Maria</persName><note resp="#ebb">Queen of England in <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford's</persName>

                        lowering of ticket prices, although the proprietors proved they would lose

However, she may also refer to one of the cultivated varieties not native to England, such as the poppy anemone (Anemone coronaria), which is native to the Mediterranean region but was cultivated in France beginning in the eighteenth century.

Period records suggest that the poem was available in at least four different forms:  as individual quarto cantos sold for 1 shilling each (some listing 'White' as the name of the publisher, although this may be a bookseller); as a 1796 quarto complete edition of all sixty-six cantos; as partial quarto editions of the middle 40 cantos (possibly gathered from individual cantos, as each were numbered separately); and a 12mo. complete edition in two volumes, with 389 pages listed as printed at Farley-Hill in 1820, of which only 12 copies were made and which were presentation copies to Dickinson's friends. Some editions appear "in boards," others in "half morocco." An auction catalog for Richard Valpy's library indicates that there were "only 12 copies, printed by the author himself, who presented this to me (ie, Richard Valpy);" another presentation copy appears in an auction catalogs for Samuel Rogers's library. Periodicals and their reviewers from 1796 do not appear to have had access to the complete work in 66 cantos but instead review partial editions of cantos 41-60 (Edinburgh Magazine); canto 38 only (Analytical Review); Cantos 38-60 (British Critic); Cantos 38 and 40 only (Monthly Review). WorldCat lists an edition of cantos 37 to 60 only from 1795. Separate listings for a two-page mock title-page for the work, attributed to Horne-Took, appear as "Speedily will be published, price 3l.6s. in boards, The travels of Cyllenius: a poem. In sixty-six cantos."
