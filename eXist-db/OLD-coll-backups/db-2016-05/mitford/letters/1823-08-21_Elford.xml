I think however the more of those few dear old friends on whose goodness &amp; sympathy I know I can rely--It is a possession--a certain good--a piece of the exquisite blue sky in a dark &amp; stormy season--&amp; of those few none are so very kind, so fine, so <choice><sic>sympathising</sic><reg>sympathizing</reg></choice> as my <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="letter"/></del> excellent friends at <placeName ref="#Bickham_village">Bickham</placeName>.  Your letter really did my heart good. I have the pleasure to tell you, that the quiet &amp; repose of the Country &amp; the entire absence of all theatrical cabal have had the happiest effect on my health &amp; mind.  I am quite well <del rend="squiggles">again</del><add place="above">now</add>, &amp; if not as hopeful as I used to be yet less anxious &amp; far less depressed than I ever expected to feel again.  This is merely the influence of the scenery, the flowers the cool yet pleasant season, &amp; the absence of all literary society--for our prospects are not other ways changed--my dear <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">father</persName>, relying with a blessed sanguineness on my poor endeavors has not I believe even <choice><sic>enquired</sic><reg>inquired</reg></choice> for a situation, &amp; I do not press matter though I anxiously wish it, being willing to give one more trial to the Theatre--If I could but get the assurance of earning for my dear dear <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">Father</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#Russell_M">Mother</persName> a humble<pb n="2"/> competence I should be the happiest creature in the world--but for these dear ties I should never write another line but go out in some situation as other destitute women do--It seems to me however my duty to try a little longer, the more especially as I am sure separation would be felt by all of us to be the greatest of all evils. My present occupation is a great secret--I will tell it to you <emph rend="underline">in strict confidence</emph>--It is the boldest attempt ever made by woman, which I have undertaken at the vehement desire of <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName>, who confesses that he has proposed the subject to every dramatic Poet of his acquaintance that it has been the wish of his life &amp; that he never met with any one courageous enough to attempt it before--In short I am engaged in a grand historical Tragedy on the greatest subject in English story <persName ref="#ChasI">Charles</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#Cromwell">Cromwell</persName>--should you ever have suspected your poor little friend of so adventurous a spirit? <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName> does not mean the Author to be known--&amp; I do not think it will be found out--which is the reason of my requesting so earnestly your silence on the subject. <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Macready</persName> thinks that my set was in great part the occasion of the intolerable malignity with which <title ref="#Julian_MRMplay">Julian</title> was attacked. They at least cannot call this a melodrama. My wish is to do strict poetical justice, in the best sense of the word, to both the men &amp; both their causes--but I am afraid I shall not be able to do so, because <persName ref="#ChasI">Charles</persName> is that desperate common place of the drama a King in distress, &amp; <persName ref="#Cromwell">Cromwell</persName> with his enthusiasm his subtlety his wonderful power over the minds of all who approach<pb n="3"/>him is the very very thing for the drama--I have nearly written the whole of that part, &amp; the one dear friend who alone knows the plan, <persName ref="#Talfourd_Thos">Mr. Talfourd</persName>, who has been &amp; who is as a brother to me, says that in what he has seen I have far outrun his hopes--You will see at once the tremendous difficulty of the undertaking &amp; even how I sometimes despair of finishing the Play &amp; am quite in doubt, whether even if I write the other characters up to <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName>(which I shall not be able to do) it will ever be represented.  I have been obliged of course to have a good deal of republicanism &amp; far more cant than I could wish--&amp; the Trial scene, which I have not done yet, frightens me whenever I think of it. There is a great deal of laborious reading, too, necessary to the undertaking--What is your opinion of <persName ref="#Cromwell">Cromwell</persName>?  Mine is that he was a man acting under an intense conviction of the justice of his cause &amp; little scrupulous as to the means employed in its furtherance--In his domestic character he appears in the old Memorials &amp; letters &amp; state papers which I have been consulting to have been delightful &amp; amiable past expression. I shall give only the short time of <persName ref="#ChasI">Charles</persName>'s being in Town before his execution--not at all varying from history except by bringing in the <persName ref="#Queen_Ch1">Queen</persName>, &amp; giving <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName> a <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/></del>loyalist <rs type="person" ref="#PrincessE_Ch1">daughter</rs>--Do you think I shall succeed?  <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Macready</persName> says he is sure of it--but I fear, I greatly fear--He himself will probably have no power at all next season since I find they have engaged <persName ref="#Young_CM">Mr. Young</persName>. But then there is <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">Foscari</title> which provided they do not make <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName><pb n="4"/>play the <persName ref="#Doge_F">Doge</persName> they are heartily welcome to perform &amp; from <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Charles Kemble's</persName> passion for that play, or rather form his passionate desire to act the hero in that play I think it not unlikely if <persName ref="#Young_CM">Mr. Young</persName> will <del rend="squiggles">play</del><add place="above">perform</add> the <persName ref="#Doge_F">Doge</persName> that they may. The <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">Foscari</title> is a pretty, interesting, graceful Tragedy--evidently written by a woman entirely free from the faults of <title ref="#Julian_MRMplay">Julian</title>, yet in my opinion of <choice><sic>inferious</sic><reg>inferior</reg></choice><note resp="#ejb"><persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> might be playing with the use of this antiquated word. "Inferious" was word used circa 1640s, at the same time that <persName ref="#Cromwell">Cromwell</persName> and <persName ref="#ChasI">Charles</persName> were living and mainly used in relation to kings and royalty.</note> merit--not so vivid or so vigorous as, false modesty apart, I cannot but feel that Play to be--Your approbation has given me the truest delight, I am aware of your kind partiality, yet I am sure that you would not tell me what you do not think--&amp; indeed I hear from many &amp; most gratifying quarters the same opinion of <title ref="#Julian_MRMplay">Julian</title>--I mean of its power--especially its dramatic power. Its faults of plot I am most ready to admit, &amp; hope to avoid in future. It must have had great power to survive the acting--except <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#Foote_Maria">Miss Foote</persName> the performers were more fit for a barn than a Theatre Royal--&amp;we had not one new scene--&amp; only one new dress! <note resp="#lmw"><persName ref="#MRM">Mitford means that no new scenery or costumes were made for the production.</persName></note>  If <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">The Foscari</title> had been brought out it was to have had entire new scenery &amp; the most splendid decorations-- &amp; that together with the <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/></del> great superiority of the general cast of characters induces me to hope that they will play it next season--It will not fail I think the first night, it is too good for that-- &amp; if it survive that ordeal <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Charles Kemble</persName>'s jealousy of <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName> would carry it on to beat <title ref="#Julian_MRMplay">Julian</title>--so that between the chance of that play &amp; of <title ref="#CharlesI_MRMplay">"Charles the First"</title> I begin to<pb n="2"/>have a little more hope than I had--only a little. Once again do not mention <title ref="#CharlesI_MRMplay">"Charles the First"</title> not to any one, especially if it should happen to come out anonymously--&amp; pray my dear friend if you should hear of any situation that would suit my dear <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">father</persName> do not fail to let me know for that work would be the real comfort to be rid of the Theatre &amp; all its troubles. Any thing in the medical line provided the income however small were certain he would be well qualified to undertake. I hope there is no want of duty in my wishing him to contribute his efforts with mine to our support--God knows if I could--if there were any certainty how willingly how joyfully I would do all--but that there is not. Pray forgive this long detail, &amp; the apparent vanity with which I have spoken of my Tragedies--casting off all the usual circumlocutions &amp; writing my very thoughts--but I have learnt to know my <gap reason="torn" unit="word" quantity="1"/><unclear><supplied resp="#ejb">self</supplied></unclear> too well for vanity--my weakness, my impatience, my many faults. If I were better, more industrious, more patient more consistent, I do think I should succeed &amp; I will try to be so I promise you I will &amp; to make the best use of my poor talents. Pray forgive this egotism it is a relief &amp; a comfort to me to pour forth my feelings to so dear &amp; so respected a friend, &amp; they are not now so desolate, not quite so desolate as they have been. God grant me to deserve success <metamark rend="jerks"/> What you say of say of your own dear family interests &amp; affects &amp; delights me.
