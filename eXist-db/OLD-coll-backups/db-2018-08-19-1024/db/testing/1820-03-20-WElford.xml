                  life <metamark place="below" function="insertion" rend="caret"/><add place="above">&amp; death</add>? It lasted 6 days--during the three last of which not more than thirty votes were polled on all sides--never to be sure were voters so filtered out drop by drop--Every unpolled elector was known on all sides--&amp; the obstinate who would not vote--the fearful who dared not--the rich who could not, were assailed morning noon &amp; night by the persuasions &amp; exhortations of the candidates &amp; their committees--Very little men were of great consequence during those three days--<said>"Has Philips voted yet?" </said><said>"How is Butler<pb n="2"/> this morning?"</said> were the common salutations amongst committee men &amp; fair ladies<supplied reason="missing" resp="#ebb">.</supplied><note resp="#ebb">Here Mitford's dash appears to terminate the sentence.</note>--Now <persName>Philips </persName> was a <choice><sic>Mill wright</sic><reg resp="#ajc">millwright</reg></choice> desperately poor who tugged at on all sides deserted his house &amp; home to escape the certainty of offending his employers on one side or other--&amp; <persName ref="#Butler_Mr">Butler</persName> a sick <orgName ref="#Palmerite">Palmerite</orgName> who kept a little shop &amp; was nursed &amp; guarded by a <orgName ref="#Weylandite">Weylandite</orgName> wife who at last not content with locking up her husband fairly flung the <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Palmer</persName> letters in the face of the messengers--so a long head of our party despairing to rescue him from her clutches paired him off with a sick <orgName ref="#Weylandite">Weylandite</orgName>.--All this time I have not told you who the Candidates were --<persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Mr. Palmer</persName> the old Member--<persName ref="#Weyland_John">Mr. Weyland</persName> the old Candidate--&amp; <persName ref="#Monck_JB">Mr. Monck</persName> an opposition man of large fortune brought from <placeName ref="#France">France</placeName> in a fit of patriotism by our celebrated shoemaker &amp; Patriot <persName>Mr. <unclear unit="chars" quantity="4"><supplied resp="#ebb">W</supplied><!--ebb: Could this be Waring? or Maury?--></unclear></persName>. <persName ref="#Monck_JB">Mr. Monck</persName> is one of the best men that ever lived--a clever man--one old &amp; most intimate friend--he has been abroad for 8 years &amp; a half &amp; yet--I was most thoroughly sorry to see him. The truth is that sending for him was an act of madness--Parties are so nearly balanced in <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> that it is impossible for two ministerial or two opposition men to sit quietly--&amp; the compromise which was desired by all but a few tÃªtes exaltees of bringing in <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Mr. Palmer</persName> &amp;<persName ref="#Weyland_John">Mr. Weyland</persName> without a contest was the only thing that could have ensured the peace of the Borough. At present by desperate &amp; despairing exertions the two opposition men are come in--but another time one must go out--&amp; that one (don't tell <persName ref="#Sinclair_SrJohn"> Sir John Sinclair</persName>) must be <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Mr. Palmer</persName>, against whom the sun was this time, &amp; whose purse is in no condition to stand these repeated contests, &amp; whose conduct has been so fair so pure so <choice><sic>honourable</sic><reg resp="#ajc">honorable</reg></choice> that it quite breaks one's heart to think of his being cast aside<pb n="3"/> in a fit of caprice--no not caprice a cold calculation made in the very spirit of trade--that a rich member living in the <choice><sic>neighbourhood</sic><reg resp="#ajc">neighborhood</reg></choice> is better than one less rich who lives at a distance. In the meanwhile all <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> is experiencing the double evils of a beginning &amp; a finished election--all the malice hatred envy &amp; ill will of the one, combined with the restless activity, the perpetual talking, the threatening promising &amp; canvassing of the other. <persName ref="#Weyland_John">Mr. Weyland</persName> had no sooner lost his election by five votes, made his mob drunk, &amp; takes himself off, than his party began to <choice><sic>organise</sic><reg resp="#ajc">organize</reg></choice> Committees in all the Parishes for the purpose of securing the Independence &amp; so forth of the Borough at the next election which of course was instantly met by counter Committees for the exactly same purpose on the other side.-- I love <persName ref="#Monck_JB">Mr. Monck</persName> (always with his wife's permission)--I like <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Mr. Palmer</persName>--&amp; I don't like <persName ref="#Weyland_John">Mr. Weyland</persName> who is a puritan of the very first water, &amp; yet I very sincerely wish that <persName ref="#Monck_JB">Mr. Monck</persName> was back at <placeName ref="#Tours_France">Tours</placeName> &amp; <persName ref="#Weyland_John">Mr. Weyland</persName> quietly in <orgName ref="#Parliament_UK">Parliament</orgName><del rend="squiggles">--<gap quantity="1" unit="word"/></del>
for <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Mr. Palmer's</persName> sake--which wish is exceedingly disinterested on my part inasmuch as I mean the new member to frank my letters &amp; shall find him much easier to catch than the old one. Have not I tired you with this tirade? Punish me in kind--But you can't--no--you <choice><sic>cant</sic><reg resp="#ebb">can't</reg></choice>--you cannot write so dully if you would--though you may certainly <choice><sic>chuse</sic><reg resp="#ebb">choose</reg></choice> the same dull subject--The only consolation to my fears for the next election is that is it less likely than appeared lately to happen soon. We saw yesterday a gentleman from <placeName ref="#Brighton">Brighton</placeName> who is intimate with <persName ref="#Tierney_SrMat">Sir Matthew Tierney</persName> &amp; who received from him a few days ago an account of the <persName ref="#GeoIV">King's</persName> health so exceedingly favorable that no man of character could<pb n="4"/> have given it had he been in so precarious a state as has been imagined--He said his <persName ref="#GeoIV">Majesty</persName> was as well as ever he had been in his life--now <persName ref="#Tierney_SrMat">Sir Matthew Tierney</persName> could not have said this of a man in whom the water was rising &amp; whose legs were cased every morning in sheet lead--as has been the constant report here abouts for the last fortnight.
