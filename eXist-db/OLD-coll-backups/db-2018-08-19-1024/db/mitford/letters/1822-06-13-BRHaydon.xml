                        <p>One sheet of folio <material>paper</material> folded into four writing surfaces (each surface photographed separately). The letter begins on the top of the first page, and continues from top to bottom of pages two through four. The text of the letter on the fourth page is split after the fifth line, allowing space for the address leaf. The address leaf is centered on the page, and oriented perpendicularly to the text. The paper is folded into thirds two additional times (forming nine rectangular regions distinguished by creases in the paper) for sealing and posting.</p>

            <p>A thousand thanks, my dear Sir, for your kind &amp; delightful letter. I felt that I had not deserved it--for I must have appeared sadly inattentive &amp; undeserving by being three days in town without waiting on <persName ref="#Haydon_Mrs">Mrs. Haydon</persName>--But you know how it happened--On the <date>Friday</date> I was not <unclear><supplied resp="#ms">sure</supplied></unclear> that you had not moved in the first place when <persName ref="Pope_Alex">Pope</persName> set out in quest of you, &amp; in the second it was necessary that I should keep myself perfectly quiet to attend an appointment with <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Mr. C Kemble</persName> at two <choice><sic>oclock</sic><reg resp="#ms">o'clock</reg></choice>--<date>Saturday</date> you were as I knew <unclear><supplied resp="#ms">out</supplied></unclear>--<date>Sunday</date> as I knew coming--besides which I was actually confined to the <rs type="place" ref="#ThreeMileCross">house</rs> on both of those days from the necessity of not missing a friend whom I was obliged to see after my interview with <rs type="person" ref="#Macready_Wm">the Manager</rs> to make sure that I might not by altering to please him displease <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName>--&amp; on <date>Sunday</date> Evening I was so unwell as to be obliged to make <unclear><supplied resp="#ms">up</supplied></unclear> my friend to disappoint myself by breaking my appointment for <date>Monday</date> morning--&amp; it was very well I did so--for <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/></del> when the morning came I was fit for nothing but to be <unclear><supplied resp="#ms">backed</supplied></unclear> off home. In fact a country lady who lives almost literally in the open air, in green fields or flowery gardens, is terribly out of her element in <placeName ref="#London_city">London</placeName> in hot weather--All the time that I was in <unclear><supplied resp="#ms">Norton</supplied></unclear> Street I felt just as I suppose that Patriarchal Larch <!--2017-08-15 ms: proposed xml:id is "#larch_eu"-->--<unclear><supplied resp="#ms">tell</supplied></unclear> of hotland must have done, when crammed into a garden hot &amp; coddled amongst the myrtles <!--2017-08-15 ms: proposed xml:id is "#myrtle_common"--> &amp; orange trees of the

                <p><persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> makes a general reference to the "Duke of Atholl" in her 13 June 1822 letter to B.R. Haydon. The Duke of Atholl lived in Blair Castle, located in Perthshire, Scotland. In 1822, John Murray, the fourth Duke of Atholl, would have been in office. Murray (as the eldest son) succeeded his father in dukedom, served from 1774 until his death in 1830, and was succeeded by his firstborn son John Murray, the fifth Duke of Atholl. Murray maintained a position in the House of Lords (of the Peerage of Great Britain) after becoming Earl Strange. He is credited with cultivating the Dunkeld Larch by cross-breeding the Japanese Larch with the European Larch.
