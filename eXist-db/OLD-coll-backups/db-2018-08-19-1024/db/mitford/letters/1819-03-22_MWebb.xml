           <handNote corresp="#pencil" medium="pencil"> Someone, apparently other than Mitford, perhaps cataloging letters and describing them, who left grey pencil marks and numbered her letters now in the Reading Central Library's collection. This letter is dated "[22 Mar. 1819]" in the top left of the first leaf.

        <editorialDecl><p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

            <p>Many thanks my dearest <rs type="person" ref="#Webb_Mary_younger">Mary</rs> for your charming note written con spirito &amp; I hope con amore<note resp="#lmw">Italian for "with spirit," and "with love."

There is but one way to repair these various misfortunes--you must come again to fetch both books &amp; flowers--you really must--you &amp; the dear dear <persName ref="#Webb_Eliza">Eliza</persName> &amp; your <pb n="2"/> charming friend <persName ref="#Wheeler_Kate">Miss Wheeler</persName>--Cannot you manage to come in the Donkey Chaise &amp; stay all night?
