              <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

            <p>I know not, <rs type="person" ref="#Talfourd_Thos">my dear friend</rs>, how to thank you sufficiently for your last &amp; kindest
               letter--which yet gave us great pain in the indifferent account which it
               contained of your health--I trust that the <placeName ref="#Oxford_Circuit">Circuit</placeName> will set you quite up again--It always
               does--Do you come by <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName>?
               And if you do can you give us a day? I want you to see my garden in its flush of
               roses &amp; lilies--&amp; I hope we need not say that we always want to see you. Just
               give me one line to say yes or no--&amp; to tell me that you are
               better--it will not be welcome without that--only one line
               mind--I will not have a long letter till you are at leisure, although
               what can have put it into your head that you are a bad letter writer I cannot
               imagine--the only possible fault of your letters would be their being too
               well written--&amp; really that is so rare a fault that one puts up with it.
               But you have the habit of making mistakes about yourself &amp; being astonished when
               people find them out, <pb n="2"/>which being a still rarer fault one puts up with
               that also.--I rejoice at <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr.
                  Macready</persName>'s <q>"wise
               determination"</q><!-- resp="#kdc": are we going to try to cross-ref this? -->—although
               there is something almost touching in the conscious infirmity of temper from whence
               it proceeds. I remember that <persName ref="#Cobbett_Wm">Mr. Cobbett</persName> once
               made a similar resolution &amp; from the same cause--but he could not hold his resolve--he had too much curiosity.
               By the way there are many points of resemblance between those two <rs type="person" ana="#Macready #Cobbett_Wm">Worthies</rs>--both men of great power in their several ways (<persName ref="#Cobbett_Wm">Mr. Cobbett</persName> much the
               greater of course)--both men of headstrong passion--zealous partizans,
               vindictive enemies, fascinating companions--both great
               bullies--&amp; as I suspect both great cowards. What do you think of this
               parallel in the manner of <persName ref="#Plutarch">Plutarch</persName>? It certainly
               is true.--</p>
            <p>I send you some more scraps of <title ref="#CharlesI_MRMplay">"Charles"</title>. You
               <!-- resp="#kdc": to the proofreader: double check that this is a small inkblot here. --><!--LMW. it's an inkblot.--> are to know that there
               will be an entirely new <emph rend="underline">first</emph> act (one scene of which
               you saw when last at <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading </placeName>) but that
               the rest of the piece will be merely a rifacimento of my old play, entirely altering
               the <emph rend="underline">tone</emph> of <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName> &amp; leaving out <persName ref="#Alice">Alice</persName> altogether.
               <pb n="3"/> The only parts quite finished are the Third &amp; Fifth
               acts--most of the new bits of which I send you--The <emph rend="underline">last</emph> scene might perhaps be rendered more vivid, by giving
               even at that moment a hope for <persName ref="#Chas1_MRM">Charles</persName>--bringing in <persName ref="#Fairfax">Fairfax</persName> sooner, &amp; sending a
               messenger to save him--but whether after the scene of the scaffold, &amp;
               with the known fate of the man before one's eyes, &amp; no <emph rend="underline">great</emph> Actor to bear one out it might not pass for a mere trick, or what
               would be worse an imitation of <persName ref="#Knowles_Sheridan">Mr.
                  Knowles</persName>, I do not know. You will see I hope a sustaining of <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName>, &amp; 
               a little improvement in <persName ref="#Chas1_MRM">Charles</persName>.--But it wants story
               terribly--If I could introduce a plot to save him--but then I
               am afraid of a number more of people &amp; bad actors--&amp; I could not bring
               it to any very great head, because there is no historical ground for the
               thing,--&amp; having in the <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" quantity="1"/><unclear/><add place="above">old</add> three acts plenty of materials
               for the two news ones--(always altering <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName> 
               as well as I can &amp; writing up <persName ref="#Chas1_MRM">Charles</persName>) why I hardly think the <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" quantity="1">thing</del>introduction
               of a plot worth the trial. Do you? My firm belief is that the play <add place="above"><metamark rend="caret" place="below"/>written</add> as it will be, would succeed if acted, but <pb n="4"/> that it will not be acted--Either <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Charles Kemble</persName>'s own cowardice, or <rs type="person" ref="#Colman_the_Younger">the licenser's</rs> qualms, will prevent the representation. I mean on account of the cant of course for as to
               politics, it will be a high <orgName ref="#Tory">Tory</orgName> play. Is <add place="above"><metamark rend="caret" place="below"/>my</add>
               <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName> worse than <persName ref="#Cantwell">Dr. Cantwell</persName> in <title ref="#Hypocrite">The
                  Hypocrite</title>? It will be singularly unlucky, if with three plays either of which would succeed if fairly acted, neither
               should come out--&amp; yet such I fully expect to be the case.--Perhaps
               <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">Foscari</title> stands the best chance. <title ref="#Stage">The letter on the Stage</title> has been copied from <title ref="#Blackwoods">Blackwood</title> into the <title ref="#Observer">Observer</title>, probably sent thither officially from 
               <placeName ref="#Covent_Garden_Theatre">C.G.T.</placeName><note resp="#kdc">An abbreviation for Covent Garden
                  Theater</note> &amp; is followed by an historical extract <note resp="#kdc">The extract, titled <title>Venice in the Middle Ages</title>,
                     describes the trials and exile of <persName ref="#Foscari_son_hist">Jacopo Foscari</persName>, son of <persName ref="#Doge_F_hist">Francesco Foscari</persName>, the Doge of <placeName>Venice</placeName>.</note>
               containing the story of the <persName ana="#Doge_F_hist #Foscari_son_hist">Two
                  Foscari</persName>--with no reference to <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">my
                     play</title>--&amp; perhaps accidental, but still the coincidence struck me,
               &amp; I should not wonder if <persName ref="#Kemble_C">C. Kemble</persName> reckoned
               on <persName ref="#Fitzharris">Mr. Fitzharris</persName> for <persName ref="#Cosmo">Cosmo</persName>, which indeed he would both look &amp; play very beautifully--I know that <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Mr. Kemble</persName>
               has in no way lost his fancy for that piece, &amp; if <persName ref="#Young_CM">Mr. Young</persName> would play the 
               <persName ref="#Doge_F">Doge</persName> I think it would do very well.<note resp="#ebb">Manuscript at the Rylands Library is missing a closer. Ends at the bottom of the sheet.</note></p>
