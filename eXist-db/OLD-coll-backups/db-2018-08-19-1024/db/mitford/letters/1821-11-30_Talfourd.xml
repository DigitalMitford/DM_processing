         <p>Thank you very much very much, <rs type="person" ref="#Talfourd_Thos">my dear Sir</rs>, for your kind letter of preparation. Ah you need not fear that I should be too sanguine--Those happy days are passed with me long long ago. I am now perfectly resigned to either of the two other Catastrophes that await me &amp; <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">Foscari</title>, the being rejected on the one hand or wretchedly acted on the other. Neither calamity can alter the sincere &amp; ardent gratitude that I shall always feel to you, my Kindest friend--though I am heartily sorry to have engaged so much of your valuable time on so worthless a subject.--No, we shall not I think gain any thing by speaking to <persName ref="#Milman_HH">Mr. Milman</persName>--It was not to me but to <rs type="person" ref="#Mitford_Geo">my father</rs> that he made the speech which I reported to you verbatim--on returning the Play, he again said that he was sorry his hands were tied--he seemed rather luke warm then <rs type="person" ref="#Mitford_Geo">my Father</rs> says--which I have no doubt resulted from his not greatly liking the Piece, indeed the little merit that it has is of quite an opposite nature to that which he admires--I cannot think that the Tragedy now in the Theater<!--LMW: try to identify play?--> is his--He could not have said &amp; repeated that he was sorry he had not known of mine before recommending another if it were. No gentleman could do such a thing. But we had better say nothing to him. It might do harm.--<persName ref="#Robins_Geo">Mr. Robins</persName> is, <rs type="person" ref="#Mitford_Geo">my father</rs> thinks, worth trying. We are sure of his kindness, &amp; some time ago he had a coniderable sum of money in the concern--whether that continues or not we do not exactly know--if it does he must<pb n="2"/> have influence, if not he probably has no other interest than that of mere personal intimacy with <persName ref="#Harris_Henry">Mr. Harris</persName>--which I agree with you in rating very low--he is also intimate with <persName ref="#Fawcett_John">Mr. Fawcett</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#Young_CM">Mr. Young</persName>--Would that do any good? At all events my father thinks <persName ref="#Robins_Geo">Mr. Robins</persName>'s interest so well worth trying that he proposes to go to <placeName ref="#London_city">Town</placeName> on <date when="1821-12-02">Sunday</date> to see him. He will take care to steer clear of Mr. Taylor<!-- LMW: check id. -->--&amp; will of course report to you his success with <persName ref="#Robins_Geo">Mr. Robins</persName>. <persName ref="#Quayle_Mr">Mr. Quayl</persName>e seems so completely have vanished from the scene that there is no use in running after him.</p>
         <p>Do you think it would do any good to get <persName ref="#James_Miss">Miss James</persName> to call on <persName ref="#Young_CM">Mr. Young</persName> or write to him? I don't know that she would--for ever since the unlucky affair of the rejected alterations she has maintained a dignified silence--that is to say that she is in a thorough fit of the sullens. Nevertheless I know so well the <del rend="squiggles" unit="chars" quantity="1"><supplied resp="#lmw">E</supplied></del> excellence &amp; kindness of her heart, that I am quite sure she would be most ready &amp; willing to do any good office to even <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" quantity="1"><supplied resp="#lmw">to</supplied></del> to a friend in disgrace--&amp; you know the opportunity of <del rend="squiggles" unit="chars" quantity="1"><supplied resp="#lmw">a</supplied></del> conferring a favor is a glorious come off for an angry lady, who happens to be rather romantic. I am quite sure of her dear soul--but I would not engage her in a troublesome solicitation unless it were likely to avail--&amp; I am very much afraid that with the present Catastrophe it is quite in vain to expect <persName ref="#Young_CM">&gt;Mr. Young</persName> to play the <persName ref="#Doge_F">Doge</persName>--though she (<persName ref="#James_Miss">Miss James</persName>) had the strange notion that his was the first character. Shall I write to her? You must tell by <rs type="person" ref="#Mitford_Geo">my father</rs> if I should.</p>
            <p>We are delighted to hear that you require no advice--Take care of yourself nevertheless--Kindest regards from all--</p>
