              diagonal lines across pages, and sometimes writing words overtop and perpendicularly
              across Mitford's writing. On this letter, a red diagonal line is drawn from the top
              left to the bottom right of pages 2, 3, and 4 of the manuscript.

Notice, we're not going to worry about indicating the bend of the annotation up the side of the page, and we wouldn't concern ourselves with Mitford's own writing if she does that.
