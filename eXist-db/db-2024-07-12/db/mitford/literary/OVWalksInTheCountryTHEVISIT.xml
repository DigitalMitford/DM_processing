            </head>
            <p><date when="--10-27">October 27th</date>.—A lovely autumnal day; the air soft, balmy, genial; the sky of that
               softened and delicate blue upon which the eye loves to rest,—the blue which gives
               such relief to the rich beauty of the earth, all around glowing in the ripe and
               mellow tints of the most gorgeous of the seasons. Really such an autumn may well
               compensate our English climate for the fine spring of the south, that spring of which
               the poets talk, but which we so seldom enjoy. Such an autumn glows upon us like a
               splendid evening; it is the very sunset of the year; and I have been tempted forth
               into a wider range of enjoyment than usual. This <emph>walk</emph> (if I may use the Irish figure
               of speech called a bull) will be a ride. A very dear <persName ref="#FHill_friend_OV"> friend</persName> has beguiled me into
               accompanying her in her pretty equipage to her beautiful home, four miles off; and
               having sent forward in the<pb n="256"/> style of a running footman the <persName ref="#FHill_groom_OV">servant</persName> who
               had driven her, she assumes the reins, and off we set.</p>
            <p>My <rs type="person" ref="#FHill_friend_OV">fair companion</rs> is a person whom nature and fortune would have spoiled if they
               could. She is one of those striking women whom a stranger cannot pass without turning
               to look again; tall and finely proportioned, with a bold Roman contour of figure and
               feature, a delicate English complexion, and an air of distinction altogether her own.
               Her beauty is duchess-like. She seems born to wear feathers and diamonds, and to form
               the grace and ornament of a court; and the noble frankness and simplicity of her
               countenance and manner confirm the impression. Destiny has, however, dealt more
               kindly by her. She is the wife of a <persName ref="#FHill_friendHusband_OV">rich country gentleman</persName> of high descent and higher
               attainments, to whom she is most devotedly attached,—the mother of a <persName ref="#FHill_Frances_OV">little girl</persName> as
               lovely as herself, and the delight of all who have the happiness of her acquaintance,
               to whom she is endeared not merely by her remarkable sweetness of temper and kindness
               of heart, but by the singular ingenuousness and openness of character which
               communicate an indescribable charm to her conversation. She is as transparent as
               water. You may see every colour, every shade of a mind as lofty and beautiful as her
               person. Talking with her is like being in the Palace of Truth described by <persName ref="#deGenlis_Mme">
                  Genlis</persName>;<note resp="#scw">A reference to a setting in <persName ref="#deGenlis_Mme">de Genlis</persName>'s <title level="m" ref="#Palace_Truth_Genlis">The Palace of Truth</title>, where...</note><pb n="257"/> and yet so kindly are her feelings, so great her indulgence
               to the little failings and foibles of our common nature, so intense her sympathy with
               the wants, the wishes, the sorrows, and the happiness of her fellow-creatures, that,
               with all her frank-speaking, I never knew her make an enemy or lose a friend.</p>
            <p>But we must get on. What would she say if she knew I was putting her into print? We
               must get on up the hill. Ah! that is precisely what we are not likely to do! <persName ref="#TheVisit_horse_OV">This
                  horse</persName>,<!--scw: I decided to mark this horse as a person as we do with pets since he plays a fairly personified role in this sketch--> this beautiful and high-bred horse, well fed, and fat and glossy, who stood
               prancing at our gate like an Arabian, has suddenly turned sulky. He does not indeed
               stand quite still, but his way of moving is little better—the slowest and most sullen
               of all walks. Even they who ply the hearse at funerals, sad-looking beasts who totter
               under black feathers, go faster. It is of no use to admonish him by whip or rein, or
               word. The <rs type="person" ref="#TheVisit_horse_OV">rogue</rs> has found out, that it is a weak and tender hand that guides him now.
               Oh for one pull, one stroke of his old driver <persName ref="#FHill_groom_OV">the groom</persName>! How he would fly! But there
               is <persName ref="#FHill_groom_OV">the groom</persName> half-a-mile before us, out of ear-shot, clearing the ground at a capital
               rate, beating us hollow. He has just turned the top of the hill;—and in a moment—aye,
               now he is out of sight, and will undoubtedly so continue till he meets us at the lawn
               gate. Well! there is no great harm. It is only prolonging the pleasure of enjoying
               together this<pb n="258"/> charming scenery in this fine weather. If once we make up
               our minds not to care how slowly our <rs type="person" ref="#TheVisit_horse_OV">steed</rs> goes, not to fret ourselves by vain
               exertions, it is no matter what his pace may be. There is little doubt of his getting
               home by sunset, and that will content us. He is, after all, a <rs type="person" ref="#TheVisit_horse_OV">fine noble animal</rs>; and
               perhaps when he finds that we are determined to give him his way, he may relent, and
               give us ours. All his sex are sticklers for dominion, though, when it is undisputed,
               some of them are generous enough to abandon it. Two or three of the most discreet
               wives of my acquaintance contrive to manage their husbands sufficiently with no
               better secret than this seeming submission; and in our case the example has the more
               weight since we have no possible way of helping ourselves.</p>
            <p>Thus philosophising, we reached the top of the hill, and viewed with <quote>“reverted eyes”</quote><note resp="#scw">Probably from <persName ref="#Gray_Thos">Thomas Gray</persName>'s <title ref="#On_PleasureArising_Vic_TG">On the Pleasure Arising from Vicissitude</title>, line 24.</note>
               the beautiful prospect that lay bathed in golden sunshine behind us. <persName ref="#Cowper">Cowper</persName> says,
               with that boldness of expressing in poetry the commonest and simplest feelings, which
               is perhaps one great secret of his originality,<cit><quote corresp="#TheTask_WC">“<l>Scenes must be beautiful,
                     which, daily seen,</l><l>Please daily, and whose novelty survives</l><l>Long
                        knowledge and the scrutiny of years.</l>”</quote></cit><!--<note resp="#scw">A quote from <title level="m" ref="#TheTask_WC">The Task</title>, Book 1.</note--> Every day I walk up this
               hill—every day I pause at the top to admire the broad winding road with the green<pb n="259"/> waste on each side, uniting it with the thickly timbered hedgerows; the
               two pretty cottages at unequal distances, placed so as to mark the bends; the village
               beyond, with its mass of roofs and clustered chimneys peeping through the trees; and
               the rich distance, where cottages, mansions, churches, towns, seem embowered in some
               wide forest, and shut in by blue shadowy hills. Every day I admire this most
               beautiful landscape; yet never did it seem to me so fine or so glowing as now. All
               the tints of the glorious autumn, orange, tawny, yellow, red, are poured in profusion
               amongst the bright greens of the meadows and turnip fields, till the eyes is satiated
               with colour; and then before us we have the common with its picturesque roughness of
               surface, tufted with cottages, dappled with water, edging off on one side into fields
               and farms and orchards, and terminated on the other by the princely <rs type="plant" ref="#oak">oak avenue</rs>. What
               a richness and variety the wild broken ground gives to the luxuriant cultivation of
               the rest of the landscape! <persName ref="#Cowper">Cowper</persName> has described it for me. How perpetually, as we
               walk in the country, his vivid pictures recur to the memory! Here is his common, and
               mine!</p>
            <cit><quote>“<l>The common overgrown with fern, and rough</l><l>With prickly gorse, that,
                  shapeless and deform’d</l><l>And dangerous to the touch, has yet its
                  bloom,</l><l>And decks itself with ornaments of gold;—</l><pb n="260"/><l><!--scw: at this point in the OV text, there is a long dash to signal some words left out of the original Cowper text-->---there
                  the turf</l><l>Smells fresh, and, rich in odoriferous herbs</l><l>And fungous
                  fruits of earth, regales the sense</l><l>With luxury of unexpected
                     sweets.</l>”</quote></cit><note resp="#scw">A quote from <title level="m" ref="#TheTask_WC">The Task</title>, Book 1, lines 526-533. The long dash on the fifth line signals that <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> has omitted several words from Cowper's text at that point.</note>
            <p>The description is exact. There, too, to the left is my cricket-ground; (<persName ref="#Cowper">Cowper</persName>’s
               common wanted that finishing grace;) and there stands <rs type="person" ref="#Kirby_Ben_OV">one solitary urchin</rs>, as if in
               contemplation of its past and future glories; for, alas! cricket is over for the
               season. Ah! it is <persName ref="#Kirby_Ben_OV">Ben Kirby</persName>, next brother to <persName ref="#Kirby_Joseph_OV">Joe</persName>, king of the youngsters, and
               probably his successor—for this Michaelmas has cost us <persName ref="#Kirby_Joseph_OV">Joe</persName>! He is promoted from the
               farm to the mansion-house, two miles off; there he cleans shoes, rubs knives, and
               runs upon errands, and is, as <rs type="person" ref="#Kirby_mother_OV">his mother</rs> expresses it, <said who="#Kirby_mother_OV" aloud="true">“a sort of ‘prentice to the
                  footman.”</said> I should not wonder if <persName ref="#Kirby_Joseph_OV">Joe</persName>, some day or other, should overtop the footman,
               and rise to be butler; and his splendid prospects must be our consolation for the
               loss of this great favourite. In the mean time we have <persName ref="#Kirby_Ben_OV">Ben</persName>.</p>
            <p><persName ref="#Kirby_Ben_OV">Ben Kirby</persName> is a year younger than <persName ref="#Kirby_Joseph_OV">Joe</persName>, and the schoolfellow and rival of <persName ref="#Eusden_Jem_OV">Jem Eusden</persName>.
               To be sure his abilities lie in rather a different line: <persName ref="#Eusden_Jem_OV">Jem</persName> is a scholar, <persName ref="#Kirby_Ben_OV">Ben</persName> is a
               wag: <persName ref="#Eusden_Jem_OV">Jem</persName> is great in figures and writing, <persName ref="#Kirby_Ben_OV">Ben</persName> in faces and mischief. His <rs type="person" ref="#parishSchoolmaster_OV">master</rs> says
               of him, that, if there were two such in the school, he must resign his<pb n="261"/>
               office; and, as far as my observation goes, the <rs type="person" ref="#parishSchoolmaster_OV">worthy pedagogue</rs> is right. <persName ref="#Kirby_Ben_OV">Ben</persName> is, it
               must be confessed, a great corrupter of gravity. He hath an exceeding aversion to
               authority and decorum, and a wonderful boldness and dexterity in overthrowing the one
               and puzzling the other. His contortions of visage are astounding. His <quote>“power over his
                  own muscles and those of other people”</quote><!--scw: so far unidentified--> is almost equal to that of <persName ref="#Liston_John">Liston</persName>; and indeed
               the original face, flat and square and Chinese in its shape, of a fine tan
               complexion, with a snub nose, and a slit for a mouth, is nearly as comical as <rs type="person" ref="#Liston_John">that
                  matchless performer</rs>’s. When aided by <persName ref="#Kirby_Ben_OV">Ben</persName>’s singular mobility of feature, his knowing
               winks and grins and shrugs and nods, together with a certain dry shrewdness, a habit
               of saying sharp things, and a marvellous gift of impudence, it forms as fine a
               specimen as possible of a humorous country boy, an oddity in embryo. Every body likes
               <persName ref="#Kirby_Ben_OV">Ben</persName>, except his butts; (which may perhaps comprise half his acquaintance;) and of
               them no one so thoroughly hates and dreads him as our <persName ref="#parishSchoolmaster_OV">parish school-master</persName>, a most
               worthy King Log<note resp="#scw">An expression meaning one who does not exercise their power/ It originates in the <persName ref="#Aesop">Aesop</persName> fable in which a log becomes king of the frogs.</note>, whom <persName ref="#Kirby_Ben_OV">Ben</persName> dumbfounds twenty times a day. He is a great ornament of
               the cricket-ground, has a real genius for the game, and displays it after a very
               original manner, under the disguise of awkwardness—as the clown shows off his agility
               in a pantomime. Nothing comes amiss to him. By the bye, he would have been the very
               lad for us in<pb n="262"/> our present dilemma; not a horse in England could master
               <persName ref="#Kirby_Ben_OV">Ben Kirby</persName>. But we are too far from him now—and perhaps it is as well that we are so.
               I believe <rs type="person" ref="#Kirby_Ben_OV">the rogue</rs> has a kindness for me, in remembrance of certain apples and nuts,
               which my usual companion<note resp="#scw">Possibly the <persName ref="#OVNarratorsFather">narrator's father</persName>.</note>, who delights in his wit, is accustomed to dole out to him.
               But it is a <persName ref="#Robin_Goodfellow">Robin Goodfellow</persName> nevertheless, a perfect <persName ref="#Robin_Goodfellow">Puck</persName>, that loves nothing on
               earth so well as mischief. Perhaps the <persName ref="#TheVisit_horse_OV">horse</persName> may be the safer conductor of the
               two.</p>
            <p>The avenue is quite alive to-day. <orgName ref="#TheVisit_oldWomen_OV">Old women</orgName> are picking up twigs and acorns, and <rs type="animal" ref="#pig">pigs</rs>
               of all sizes doing their utmost to spare them the latter part of the trouble; <orgName ref="#TheVisit_boysGirls_OV">boys
                  and girls</orgName> groping for beech-nuts under yonder clump; and a group of <orgName ref="#TheVisit_youngerKids_OV">younger elves</orgName>
               collecting as many dead leaves as they can find to feed the bonfire which is smoking
               away so briskly amongst the trees,—a sort of rehearsal of the grand bonfire nine days
               hence; of the loyal conflagration of the arch traitor <persName ref="#Fawkes_Guy">Guy Vaux</persName>, which is annually
               solemnized in the avenue, accompanied with as much of squibbery and crackery as our
               boys can beg or borrow—not to say steal. <persName ref="#Kirby_Ben_OV">Ben Kirby</persName> is a great man on the <date when="--11-05">fifth of
                  November</date>. All the savings of a month, the hoarded half-pence, the new farthings, the
               very luck-penny, go off <emph><foreign xml:lang="it">in fumo</foreign></emph> on that night. For my part, I like this day-light
               mockery better. There is no gunpowder—odious<pb n="263"/> gunpowder! no noise but the
               merry shouts of the <orgName ref="#TheVisit_boysGirls_OV #TheVisit_youngerKids_OV">small fry</orgName>, so shrill and happy, and the cawing of the <rs type="animal" ref="#rook">rooks</rs>, who
               are wheeling in large circles overhead, and wondering what is going forward in their
               territory—seeming in their loud clamour to ask what that light smoke may mean that
               curls so prettily amongst their old <rs type="plant" ref="#oak">oaks</rs>, towering as if to meet the clouds. There is
               something very intelligent in the ways of that black people the <rs type="animal" ref="#rook">rooks</rs>, particularly
               in their wonder. I suppose it results from their numbers and their unity of purpose,
               a sort of collective and corporate wisdom. Yet <rs type="animal" ref="#goose">geese</rs> congregate also; and <rs type="animal" ref="#goose">geese</rs> never
               by any chance look wise. But then <rs type="animal" ref="#goose">geese</rs> are a domestic fowl; we have spoiled them;
               and <rs type="animal" ref="#rook">rooks</rs> are free commoners of nature, who use the habitations we provide for them,

            <p>What a labyrinth of a road this is! I do think there are four turnings in the short
               half-mile between the avenue and the mill. And what a pity, as <rs type="person" ref="#FHill_friend_OV">my companion</rs>
               observes—not that our good and jolly <persName ref="#villageMiller_OV">miller</persName>, the very representative of the old

               the pulling-down of the prettiest old mill that ever looked at itself in the <placeName ref="#Loddon">Loddon</placeName>,
               with the picturesque low-browed irregular cottage, which stood with its light-pointed
               roof, its clustered chim-<pb n="264"/>neys, and its ever-open door, looking like the
               real abode of comfort and hospitality, to build this huge, staring, frightful,
               red-brick mill, as ugly as a manufactory, and this great square house, ugly and red
               to match, just behind. The old buildings always used to remind me of <persName ref="#Woollett_Wm"><sic>Wollett</sic></persName>’s
               beautiful engraving of a scene in <title ref="#Maid_of_Mill">the Maid of the Mill</title>. It will be long before any

            <p>Here is that monstrous machine of a tilted waggon, with its load of flour, and its

               way. If he does not, I am sure we cannot make him; and that enormous ship upon
               wheels, that ark on dry land, would roll over us like the car of Jaggernaut.<!--scw: INCLUDE OED DEF?-->
               Really—Oh no! there is no danger now. I should have remembered that it is my friend

               And <persName ref="#Long_Samuel_OV">Samuel</persName> has put us on our way, steered us safely past his waggon, escorted us over
               the bridge; and now, having seen us through our immediate difficulties, has parted
               from us with a very civil bow and good-humoured smile, as one who is always civil and
               good-humoured, but with a certain triumphant masterful look in his eyes, which I
                  have<pb n="265"/> noted in men, even the best of them, when a woman gets into
               straits by attempting manly employments. He has done us great good though, and may be
               allowed his little feeling of superiority. The parting salute he bestowed on our
               steed, in the shape of an astounding crack of his huge whip, has put that refractory
               animal on his mettle. On we go fast! past the <persName ref="#villageGlazier_OV">glazier</persName>’s pretty house, with its porch
               and its <rs type="plant" ref="#filbert">filberd</rs> walk; along the narrow lane bordered with <rs type="plant" ref="#elm">elms</rs>, whose fallen leaves

               slackens his pace accordingly. Perhaps he feels the beauty of the road just here, and
               goes slowly to enjoy it. Very beautiful it certainly is. The park paling forms the
               boundary on one side, with fine clumps of <rs type="plant" ref="#oak">oak</rs>, and <rs type="animal" ref="#deer">deer</rs> in all attitudes; the water,
               tufted with <rs type="plant" ref="#alder">alders</rs>, flowing along on the other. Another turn, and the water winds
               away, succeeded by a low hedge, and a sweep of green meadows; whilst the park and its
               paling are replaced by a steep bank, on which stands a small, quiet, village
               ale-house; and<pb n="266"/> higher up, embosomed in wood, is the little country

            <p>Ah! here is a higher hill rising before us, almost like a mountain. How grandly the
               view opens as we ascend over that wild bank, overgrown with <rs type="plant" ref="#fern">fern</rs>, and heath, and
               <rs type="plant" ref="#gorse">gorse</rs>, and between those tall <rs type="plant" ref="#holly">hollies</rs>, glowing with their coral berries! What an

               our horse, who has walked over so much level ground, has now, inspired, I presume, by
               a desire to revisit his stable, taken it into that unaccountable noddle of his to
               trot up this, the very steepest hill in the county. Here we are on the top; and in
               five minutes we have reached the lawn gate, and are in the very midst of that
               beautiful piece of art or nature (I do not know to which class it belongs), the

               exerted with more magical skill than in these plantations. Thirty years ago this
               place had no existence; it was a mere undistinguished tract of field and meadow and
               common land; now it is a mimic forest, delighting the eye with the finest
               combinations of trees and shrubs, the rarest effects of form and foliage, and
               bewildering the mind with its green glades, and impervious recesses, and apparently
               interminable extent. It is the triumph of landscape gardening, and never more
               beautiful than in this autumn sunset, lighting up the ruddy <rs type="plant" ref="#beech">beech</rs> and the spotted
               <rs type="plant" ref="#sycamore">sycamore</rs>, and gilding the shining fir-cones that hang so thickly amongst the dark
               <rs type="plant" ref="#pine">pines</rs>. The <rs type="animal" ref="#robin">robins</rs> are singing around us, as if they too felt the magic of the hour.
               How gracefully the road winds through the leafy labyrinth, leading imperceptibly to
               the more ornamented sweep. Here we are at the door amidst <rs type="plant" ref="#geranium">geraniums</rs>, and <rs type="plant" ref="#carnation">carnations</rs>,
               and <rs type="plant" ref="#jasmine">jasmines</rs>, still in flower. Ah! here is a flower sweeter than all, a bird gayer
               than the robin, the little bird that chirps to the tune of <said who="#FHill_Frances_OV" aloud="true">“mamma! mamma!”</said> the

               time enough to catch the last rays of the sun, as they light the noble landscape

            <p><date when="--10-28">October 28</date>.—Another soft and brilliant morning. But the pleasures of to-day must be
               written in short-hand. I have left myself no room for notes of admiration.</p>
            <p>First we drove about the coppice; an extensive wood of <rs type="plant" ref="#oak">oak</rs>, and <rs type="plant" ref="#elm">elm</rs>, and <rs type="plant" ref="#beech">beech</rs>,
               chiefly <rs type="plant" ref="#oak">the former</rs>, which adjoins the park paling of <placeName ref="#F_Hill_OV">F. Hill</placeName>, of which demesne,
               indeed, it forms one of the most delightful parts. The roads through the coppice are
               studiously wild, so that they have the appearance of mere cart tracts: and the manner
               in which the ground is tumbled about, the steep declivities, the sunny slopes, the
               sudden swells and falls, now a close narrow valley, then a sharp ascent to an
               eminence, commanding an immense extent of prospect, have a striking air of natural
               beauty, developed and heightened by the perfection of art. All this, indeed, was
               familiar to me; the colouring only was new. I had been there in early spring, when
               the fragrant palms were on the <rs type="plant" ref="#willow">willow</rs>, and the yellow tassels on the <rs type="plant" ref="#hazel">hazel</rs>, and every
               twig was swelling with renewed life; and I had been there again and again in the
               green leanness of midsummer; but never as now, when the dark verdure of the
               <rs type="plant" ref="#fir">fir-plantations</rs>,<pb n="269"/> hanging over the picturesque and unequal paling,
               partly covered with <rs type="plant" ref="#moss">moss</rs> and <rs type="plant" ref="#ivy">ivy</rs>, contrasts so remarkably with the shining
               orange-leaves of the <rs type="plant" ref="#beech">beech</rs>, already half fallen, the pale yellow of the scattering
               <rs type="plant" ref="#elm">elm</rs>, the deeper and richer tints of the <rs type="plant" ref="#oak">oak</rs>, and the glossy stems of the <q>“lady of the
                  woods,”</q> the delicate weeping <rs type="plant" ref="#birch">birch</rs>.<note resp="#scw">This reference to the weeping birch tree as <cit><q>the lady of the woods</q></cit> is from <title level="a" ref="#ThePicture_STC">The Picture</title> by <persName ref="#Coleridge_ST">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</persName>.</note> The underwood is no less picturesque. The
               red-spotted leaves, and redder berries of the old <rs type="plant" ref="#thorn">thorns</rs>, the scarlet festoons of the
               <rs type="plant" ref="#bramble">bramble</rs>, the tall fern of every hue, seem to vie with the brilliant mosaic of the
               ground, now covered with dead leaves, and strewn with fircones, now, where a little
               glade intervenes, gay with various <rs type="plant" ref="#moss">mosses</rs> and splendid <rs type="plant" ref="#fungus">fungi</rs>. How beautiful is this
               coppice to-day! especially where the little spring, as clear as crystal, comes
               bubbling out from the <soCalled><q>“old fantastic”</q></soCalled><!--scw: FIND THIS IF QUOTE--> beech root, and trickles over the grass, bright
               and silent as the dew in a May morning. The <rs type="animal" ref="#wood_pigeon">wood pigeons</rs> (who are just returned from
               their summer migration, and are cropping the ivy berries) add their low cooings, the
               very note of love, to the slight fluttering of the fallen leaves in the quiet air,
               giving a voice to the sunshine and the beauty. This coppice is a place to live and
               die in. But we must go. And how fine is the ascent which leads us again into the
               world, past those cottages hidden as in a pit, and by that hanging orchard and that
                  rough<pb n="270"/> heathy bank! The scenery in this one spot has a wildness, an
               abruptness of rise and fall, rare in any part of England, rare above all in this rich
               and lovely but monotonous county. It is <placeName ref="#Switzerland">Switzerland</placeName> in miniature.</p>
            <p>And now we cross the hill to pay a morning visit to the <orgName ref="#FHill_greatFamily_OV">family</orgName> at the great
               house,—another fine place, commanding another fine sweep of country. The park,
               studded with old trees, and sinking gently into a valley, rich in wood and water, is
               in the best style of ornamental landscape, though more according to the common
               routine of gentlemen’s seats than the singularly original place which we have just
               left. <!--scw: Maybe Farley Hall? -->There is, however, one distinctive beauty in the grounds of the great
               house;—the magnificent <rs type="plant" ref="#fir">firs</rs> which shade the terraces and surround the sweep, giving

               effect almost magical, as the huge red trunks, garlanded with ivy, stand out from the
               deep shadows like an army of giants. In-doors—Oh I must not take my readers in-doors,
               or we shall never get away!—In-doors the sunshine is brighter still; for there, in a
               lofty lightsome room, sits a <rs type="person" ref="#FHill_friend_OV">damsel fair</rs> and arch and piquante, one whom <persName ref="#Titian">Titian</persName> or
