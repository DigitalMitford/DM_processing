           <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

It is probable that she is referring to an edition of “The general history of Spain: from the first peopling of it by Tubal, till the death of King Philip III” that was first published in London in 1699, as one of the first English translations of Marian’s work.</note>
