(Do you understand purpled sentence?) In shock after having coaxed and persuaded you to <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="letter"/></del><emph rend="underline">lend</emph> me the plaything I wanted, &amp; which you are afraid I shall spoil, nothing is more profitable, than that I may either make no use of it at all--or that I may make the precise use which you point out. <choice><sic>Any way</sic><reg>Anyway</reg></choice>, I am glad to see these poor <rs type="letter">letters</rs> again (for I do not think that I have ever written any with so little reserve so much <foreign>con amore</foreign>) &amp; I promise you to keep them safely <emph rend="underline">for you</emph>--not to spoil them--if I can possibly help it in my way--<choice><sic>tho</sic><reg>though</reg></choice> look them over with the view to make a fortune <add place="above"><metamark place="below" function="insertion" rend="caret"/>or fool</add> of them if I can,--before I proceed to the <emph rend="underline">gutting</emph> process I threatented. Is this making as much amends as I can for my unreasonableness?--As to their mode of conveyance, that which I should much prefer would be your bringing them here (Do come &amp; see me my dear <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William</persName>--but if you would do that--there is a very safe &amp; certain mode of conveyance--<persName ref="#Monck_JB">Mr. Monck</persName> is in town for the <persName>Lord Mayor</persName>'s dinner &amp; returns Wednesday, &amp; if you will have the goodness to send the packet directed to me to his care <placeName>No. 10 Barton Street, Westminster</placeName>--it will reach me very safely. Nevertheless as I said before I should greatly rather receive the <rs type="letter">letters</rs> from your own kind hand. It is too long since we have seen you--&amp; as to my going to <placeName ref="#London_city">Town</placeName> I have no prospect of that this Spring.--You are very saucy with your Hieroglyphics &amp; as much mistaken <pb n="2"/> as a man can be. You were deceived I hope in the management of your <emph rend="underline">eyes</emph> &amp; tongue when you saw <persName ref="#Haydon">Mr. H.</persName> (I know that you have seen him.) He says the <title ref="#Lazarus_Haydon">Lazarus</title> shall be the best picture he has painted yet, but that that shall be a nonentity if he lives to <note resp="#mco"><persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> appears to omit the word "complete" here.</note> those that he will paint in the future. This is the true spirit--Is it not? Tell me what you think of a <unclear>gala</unclear> at <placeName ref="#Richmond">Richmond</placeName> which <persName ref="#Hofland_TC">Mr. Hofland</persName> has just sent to <placeName>Somerset House</placeName>. <persName ref="#Hofland_B">His wife</persName> (one good judge) says that it is excellent--equal to <title ref="#ChrstEJrslm_Haydon">Jerusalem</title>--&amp; <persName ref="#Miss_James">Miss James</persName> (<add place="above"><metamark place="below" function="insertion" rend="caret"/>also a good</add><del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/></del> judge) says that it is detestable--I incline to the latter because I know that <persName ref="#Hofland_TC">Mr. Hofland</persName> like many other fine landscape painters fails in figures. But I want your opinion. By the way I must tell you a remarkable circumstance which has just happened to <persName ref="#Hofland_B">Mrs. Hofland</persName>--They have been for many years engaged in a <placeName ref="#Chancery">Chancery</placeName> suit on the expected success of which they have placed great reliance--It has been given in their favor but as the costs are to be paid out of the property not a farthing will come to them. At first however they knew nothing <del rend="strikethrough">for</del> of this for their solicitor having neglected to write &amp; they heard only from a neighbour that the <persName>Chancellor's</persName> decree was in their favor &amp; <persName ref="#Hofland_B">Mrs. Hofland</persName> immediately set off for <placeName ref="#London_city">London</placeName> to learn the particulars--She was quite overcome by what she heard, &amp; was about to mount the outside of the <orgName>Twickenham Coach</orgName> to return <foreign>"all amort"</foreign> as you must suppose, when recollecting she should save six pence in going by the <orgName>Richmond Stage</orgName>--&amp; such a one being at hand, she withdrew her foot although a most respectable woman with her husband at her side offered to make room for her. However she left by the <orgName>Richmond Coach</orgName> &amp; saved her six pence--&amp; her life. The <orgName>Twickenham Coach</orgName> was overturned an hour after, &amp; that decent woman in whose place she would have sat killed on the spot. The husband had his <choice><sic>collar bone</sic><reg>collarbone</reg></choice> &amp; a rib broken. This most striking event gave a new &amp; just turn to her thoughts--<persName ref="#Miss_James">Miss James</persName><add place="above"><metamark place="below" function="insertion" rend="caret"/>says</add> nothing was ever half so pathetic as her manner of detailing it. <pb n="3"/> Two things in this neighbourhood annoy me very much--First &amp; most <persName ref="#Dickinson">Mr. Dickinson</persName>--he is really killing himself. Never man had such symptoms of approaching apoplexy, &amp; because he has all his life combated the received theories of medicine especially what he calls the <unclear><gap quantity="1" unit="word" reason="illegible"/></unclear> system (which was of no consequence whilst confined to mere speculative harangues) he is now determined to stand by his opinions to the last, &amp; really will rather die by the blood rushes to <gap reason="torn" quantity="2" unit="chars"/><unclear><supplied resp="#mco">his</supplied></unclear> head than live by the lancet. Is not this vicious? Has a man any right to take himself out of the world before his time from sheer obstinacy, when <add place="above">all his friends</add><del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="2" unit="word"/></del> want <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="chars"/></del> him to live life merry? <choice><sic>Every body</sic><reg>Everybody</reg></choice> has warned him--two physicians to my knowledge &amp; three apothecaries-- &amp; not counting <emph rend="underline">me</emph> a quack--but he is absolutely unpersuadable &amp; has made <persName ref="#Dickinson">Mr. Dickinson</persName> believes he knows more of physic than <choice><sic>every one</sic><reg>everyone</reg></choice> else.--The other calamity need not annoy me in the least--but it does <unclear><gap reason="torn" quantity="2" unit="chars"/><supplied resp="#mco">nonetheless</supplied></unclear>. You shall hear it. The <persName ref="#Wellington_Duke">Duke of Wellington</persName>'s sons are home for the Eton holidays, &amp; they are <choice><sic>every day</sic><reg>everyday</reg></choice> little <gap reason="torn" quantity="2" unit="words"/><unclear><supplied resp="#mco">ale house</supplied></unclear> next door to take lessons in French of a Jew who is lodging there purposely to teach them. "The poor little lads ma'am" said my neighbour the landlord "are kept very strict--they never look up but their tutor corrects them, &amp; there they sit in my parlour from eleven <choice><sic>oclock</sic><reg>o'clock</reg></choice> till half past four &amp; never have a glass of anything." Without sympathasizing very deeply in the last grievance enumerated by my friend taproom, I am quite indignant at the poor little boys being cheated out of their <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/></del> holidays. Learning French from fools when they ought to be playing cricket or stealing bird's nests or doing mischief or doing nothing--beating Napoleon was a joke to this wickedness. The only thing which even looks like the holidays is their mode of conveyance which is generally five in a gig rain or shine--once they came on horseback &amp; then they had a humpbacked boy on a donkey galloping <unclear><gap quantity="2" unit="chars" reason="folded"/><supplied resp="#mco">off</supplied></unclear> <!--I have invented the gap tag folded but it only exists in this letter thus far--><pb n="4"/> them by way of footman to carry their books. <metamark rend="waves"/></p><p>I must finish soon--for I have no frank--<persName ref="Monck_JB">Mr. Monck</persName> is I suppose Lord-Mayoring &amp; <persName ref="Mr_Palmer_">Mr. Palmer </persName>has made himself wings &amp; flown away--I have not seen him these six months.
