And so it is. </p><p><persName>Dame Wilson</persName> was a respected servant in a most respectable family, where she passed all the early part of her life, and which she quitted only on her marriage with a <persName>man of character and industry,</persName> and of that peculiar universality of genius which forms, what is called in country phrase, a handy fellow. He could do any sort of work; was <persName>thatcher,</persName><persName>carpenter,</persName><persName>bricklayer,</persName><pb n="17"/><persName>painter,</persName><persName>gardener,</persName><persName>gamekeeper,</persName><quote>"every thing by turns, and nothing long."</quote> No job came amiss to him. He <rs type="work">killed</rs><rs type="animal">pigs,</rs><rs type="work">mended shoes,</rs><rs type="work">cleaned clocks,</rs><rs type="work">doctored</rs><rs type="animal">cows,</rs><rs type="animal">dogs,</rs> and <rs type="animal">horses,</rs> and even went as far as <rs type="work">bleeding</rs> and <rs type="work">drawing teeth</rs> in his experiments on the human subject. In addition to these multifarious talents, he was ready, obliging, and unfearing; jovial withal, and fond of good-fellowship; and endowed with a promptness of resource which made him the general adviser of the stupid, the puzzled, and the timid. He was universally admitted to be the cleverest man in the parish; and his death, which happened about ten years ago, in consequence of standing in the water, drawing a <geogFeat>pond</geogFeat> for one neighbour, at a time when he was over-heated by <rs type="work">loading hay</rs> for another, made quite a gap in our <placeName>village</placeName> commonwealth. <persName>John Wilson</persName> had no rival, and has had no successor:—for the <persName>Robert Ellis,</persName> whom <persName>certain youngsters</persName> would fain exalt to a co-partnery of fame, is simply nobody—a <persName>bell-ringer,</persName> a <persName>ballad-singer</persName>—a <persName>troller of profane catches</persName>—a <persName>fiddler</persName>—a <persName>bruiser</persName>—a <persName>loller on <orgName>alehouse</orgName> benches</persName>—a <persName>teller of good stories</persName>—a <persName>mimic</persName>—a <persName>poet!</persName>—What is all this to compare with the solid parts of <persName>John Wilson?</persName> Whose clock hath <persName>Robert Ellis</persName><rs type="work">cleaned?</rs>—whose windows hath he <rs type="work">mended?</rs>—whose dog hath he <rs type="work">broken?</rs>—whose pigs hath he <rs type="work">rung?</rs>—whose pond hath he <rs type="work">fished?</rs>—whose hay hath he <rs type="work">saved?</rs>—whose <rs type="animal">cow</rs> hath he <rs type="work">cured?</rs>—whose <rs type="animal">calf</rs> hath<pb n="18"/> he <rs type="work">killed?</rs>—whose teeth hath he <rs type="work">drawn?</rs> whom hath he <rs type="work">bled?</rs> Tell me that, irreverent whipsters! No! John Wilson is not to be replaced. He was missed by the whole <orgName>parish;</orgName> and most of all he was missed at home. His excellent <persName>wife</persName> was left the sole guardian and protector of two fatherless <persName>girls;</persName> one an <persName>infant</persName> at her knee, the other a pretty handy <persName>lass about nine years old.</persName> Cast thus upon the world, there must have been much to endure, much to suffer; but it was borne with a smiling patience, a hopeful cheeriness of spirit, and a decent pride, which seemed to command success as well as respect in their struggle for independence. Without assistance of any sort, by <rs type="work">needle-work,</rs> by by <rs type="work">washing</rs> and by <rs type="work">mending</rs> lace and fine linen, and other by <rs type="work">skilful and profitable labours,</rs> and by the produce of her <placeName>orchard</placeName> and <rs type="animal">poultry,</rs><persName>Dame Wilson</persName> contrived to maintain herself and <persName>her children</persName> in their old comfortable home. There was no visible change; she and the <persName>little girls</persName> were as neat as ever; the <rs type="building">house</rs> had still within and without the same sunshiny cleanliness, and the <placeName>garden</placeName> was still famous over all other gardens for its <rs type="plant">cloves,</rs> and <rs type="flora">stocks,</rs> and double <rs type="flora">wall-flowers.</rs> But the sweetest <rs type="flora">flower</rs> of the garden, the joy and pride of her mother's heart, was her daughter <persName>Hannah.</persName> Well might she be proud of her! At sixteen <persName>Hannah Wilson</persName> was, beyond a doubt, the prettiest girl in the village, and the best. Her beauty was quite in a different style from the common <pb n="19"/><rs type="flora">country rosebud</rs>—far more choice and rare. Its chief characteristic was modesty. A light youthful figure, exquisitely graceful and rapid in all its movements; springy, elastic, and buoyant as a <rs type="animal">bird,</rs> and almost as shy; a fair innocent face, with downcast blue eyes, and smiles and blushes coming and going almost with her thoughts; a low soft voice, sweet even in its monosyllables; a dress remarkable for neatness and propriety, and borrowing from her delicate beauty an air of superiority not its own;—such was the outward woman of <persName>Hannah.</persName> Her mind was very like her person; modest, graceful, gentle, affectionate, grateful, and generous above all. The generosity of the poor is always a very real and fine thing: they give what they want; and <persName>Hannah</persName> was of all poor people the most generous. She loved to give; it was her pleasure, her luxury. Rosy-cheeked <rs type="plant">apples,</rs><rs type="plant">plums</rs> with the bloom on them, <rs type="plant">nosegays of cloves</rs> and blossomed <rs type="plant">myrtle;</rs><!--Note, vegetables and fruits tagged as plants--> these were offerings which <persName>Hannah</persName> delighted to bring to those whom she loved, or those who had shown her kindness; whilst to such of her neighbours as needed other attentions than <rs type="plant">fruit</rs> and <rs type="flora">flowers,</rs> she would give her time, her assistance, her skill; for <persName>Hannah</persName> inherited her <persName>mother's</persName> dexterity in <rs type="work">feminine employments,</rs> with something of her <persName>father's</persName> versatile power. Besides being an excellent <persName>laundress,</persName> she was accomplished in all <rs type="work">the arts of the needle,</rs><rs type="work">millinery,</rs><rs type="work">dress-making,</rs> and <rs type="work">plain work;</rs> a capital <persName>cutter</persName>-<pb n="20"/>out, an incomparable <persName>mender,</persName> and endowed with a gift of <persName>altering,</persName> which made old things better than new. She had no rival at a <emph><foreign>rifacimento,</foreign></emph> as half the turned gowns on the <geogFeat>common</geogFeat> can witness. As a <persName>dairy-woman,</persName> and a <persName>rearer of <rs type="animal">pigs</rs></persName> and <rs type="animal">poultry,</rs> she was equally successful: none of her <rs type="animal">ducks</rs> and <rs type="animal">turkeys</rs> ever died of neglect or carelessness, or, to use the phrase of the <placeName>poultry-yard</placeName> on such occasions, of <quote>"ill luck."</quote><persName>Hannah's</persName><rs type="animal">fowls</rs> never dreamed of sliding out of the world in such an ignoble way; they all lived to be killed, to make a noise at their deaths, as <rs type="animal">chickens</rs> should do. She was also a famous <quote><soCalled>"scholar;"</soCalled></quote><rs type="work">kept accounts,</rs><rs type="work">wrote bills,</rs><rs type="work">read letters, and answered them;</rs> was a trusty <persName>accomptant,</persName> and a safe <persName>confidante.</persName> There was no end to <persName>Hannah's</persName> usefulness or <persName>Hannah's</persName> kindness; and her prudence was equal to either. Except to be kind or useful, she never left her home; attended no fairs, or revels, or Mayings;<!--tag country events and activities--> went no where but to <orgName>church;</orgName> and seldom made a nearer approach to rustic revelry than by standing at her own garden-gate on a Sunday evening, with her little sister in her hand, to look at the <persName>lads </persName>and <persName>lasses</persName> on the <geogFeat>green.</geogFeat> In short, our <persName>village beauty</persName> had fairly reached her twentieth year without a sweetheart, without the slightest suspicion of her having ever written a love-letter on her own account; when, all on a sudden, appearances changed. She was missing at the "accustomed gate;" and one had seen a<pb n="21"/><persName>young man</persName> go into <persName>Dame Wilson's;</persName> and another had descried a <persName>trim elastic figure</persName> walking, not unaccompanied, down a <geogFeat>shady lane.</geogFeat> Matters were quite clear. <persName>Hannah</persName> had gotten a <persName>lover;</persName> and, when poor little <persName>Susan,</persName> who, deserted by <persName>her sister,</persName> ventured to peep rather nearer to the gay groupe, was laughingly questioned on the subject, the hesitating No, and the half Yes, of the <persName>smiling child,</persName> were equally conclusive. </p><p>Since the new marriage act*,<note type="author" anchored="true">It is almost unnecessary to observe that this little story was writ- ten during the short life of that whimsical experiment in legislation.</note> we, who belong to <orgName>country magistrates,</orgName> have gained a priority over the rest of the <orgName>parish</orgName> in matrimonial news. We (the privileged) see on a work-day the names which the sabbath announces to the generality. Many a blushing awkward <persName>pair</persName> hath our little lame <persName>clerk</persName> (a sorry <persName type="myth">Cupid!)</persName> ushered in between dark and light to stammer and hacker, to bow and curtsey, to sign or make a mark, as it pleases Heaven. One Saturday, at the usual hour, the limping <persName>clerk</persName> made his appearance; and, walking through our little <rs type="building">hall,</rs> I saw a <persName>fine athletic young man,</persName> the very image of health and vigour, mental and bodily, holding the hand of a <persName>young woman,</persName> who, with her head half buried in a <rs type="flora">geranium</rs> in the window, was turning bashfully away, listening, and yet not seeming to listen, to his tender whispers. The shrinking grace of that <pb n="22"/>bending figure was not to be mistaken. <persName>"Hannah!"</persName> and she went aside with me, a rapid series of questions and answers conveyed the story of courtship. <said>"William was,"</said> said <persName>Hannah,</persName><said>"a <persName>journeyman hatter</persName> in <placeName>B.</placeName> He had walked over one Sunday evening to see the cricketing, and then he came again. <persName>Her mother</persName> liked him. Every body liked her <persName>William</persName>—and she had promised—she was going—was it wrong?"</said>— <said>" Oh no!—and where are you to live?"</said>—<said>"<persName>William</persName> has got a room in <placeName>B.</placeName> He works for <persName>Mr. Smith,</persName> the <persName>rich hatter</persName> in the <orgName>market-place,</orgName> and <persName>Mr. Smith</persName> speaks of him—oh, so well! But <persName>William</persName> will not tell me where our room is. I suppose in some narrow <placeName>street</placeName> or <placeName>lane,</placeName> which he is afraid I shall not like, as our <geogFeat>common</geogFeat> is so pleasant. He little thinks—any where."</said>—She stopped suddenly; but her blush and her clasped hands finished the sentence, <said>"any where with him!"</said>—<said>"And when is the happy day?"</said>—<said>"On Monday fortnight, Madam,"</said> said the <persName>bridegroom elect,</persName> advancing with the little <persName>clerk</persName> to summon <persName>Hannah</persName> to the parlour, <said>"the earliest day possible."</said> He drew her arm through his, and we parted.</p><p>The Monday fortnight was a glorious morning; one of those rare November days when the sky and the air are soft and bright as in April. <said>"What a beautiful day for <persName>Hannah!</persName>"</said> was the first exclamation of the breakfast table. <said>"Did she tell you where they should dine?"</said><pb n="23"/>—<said>"No, Ma'am; I forgot to ask."</said>—<said>"I can tell you,"</said> said the <persName>master of the house,</persName> with somewhat of good-humoured importance in his air, somewhat of the look of a man who, having kept a secret as long as it was necessary, is not sorry to get rid of the burthen. <said>"I can tell you: in <placeName>London.</placeName>"</said>—<said>"In <placeName>London</placeName>!"</said>—<said>"Yes. Your little favourite has been in high luck. She has married the <persName>only son</persName> of one of the best and richest men in <placeName>B.,</placeName><persName>Mr. Smith,</persName> the great hatter. It is quite a romance,"</said> continued he: <said>"<persName>William Smith</persName> walked over one Sunday evening to see a match at cricket. He saw our pretty <persName>Hannah,</persName> and forgot to look at the <orgName>cricketers.</orgName> After having gazed his fill, he approached to address her, and the <persName>little damsel</persName> was off like a <rs type="animal">bird.</rs><persName>William</persName> did not like her the less for that, and thought of her the more. He came again and again; and at last contrived to tame this wild <rs type="animal">dove,</rs> and even to get the entrée of the <rs type="building">cottage.</rs> Hearing <persName>Hannah</persName> talk, is not the way to fall out of love with her. So <persName>William,</persName> at last finding his case serious, laid the matter before <persName>his father,</persName> and requested his consent to the marriage. <persName>Mr. Smith</persName> was at first a little startled; but <persName>William</persName> is an only son, and an excellent son; and, after talking with me, and looking at <persName>Hannah,</persName> (I believe her sweet face was the more eloquent advocate of the two,) he relented; and having a spice of <persName>his son's</persName> romance, finding that he had not mentioned his situation in life, he made a point of its<pb n="24"/> being kept secret till the wedding-day. We have managed the business of settlements; and <persName>William,</persName> having discovered that his <persName>fair bride</persName> has some curiosity to see London, (a curiosity, by the bye, which I suspect she owes to you or poor <persName>Lucy,</persName>) intends taking her tither for a fortnight. He will then bring her home to one of the best <rs type="building">houses</rs> in <placeName>B.,</placeName> a fine <placeName>garden,</placeName> fine furniture, fine clothes, fine servants, and more money than she will know what to do with. Really the surprise of <persName>Lord E.'s farmer's daughter,</persName> when, thinking she had married <persName>his steward,</persName> he brought her to <placeName>Burleigh,</placeName> and installed her as its mistress, could hardly have been greater. I hope the shock will not kill <persName>Hannah</persName> though, as is said to have been the case with that <persName>poor lady.</persName>"</said>— <said>"Oh no! <persName>Hannah</persName> loves <persName>her husband</persName> too well. Any where with him!"</said></p><p>And I was right. <persName>Hannah</persName> has survived the shock. She is returned to <placeName>B.,</placeName> and I have been to call on her. I never saw any thing so delicate and bride-like as she looked in her white gown and her lace mob, in a room light and simple, and tasteful and elegant, with nothing fine except some beautiful <rs type="plant">green-house plants.</rs> Her reception was a charming mixture of sweetness and modesty, a little more respectful than usual, and far more shamefaced! Poor thing! her cheeks must have pained her! But this was the only difference. In every thing else she is still the same <persName>Hannah,</persName> and has lost none of<pb n="25"/> her old habits of kindness and gratitude. She was making a handsome matronly cap, evidently for <persName>her mother,</persName> and spoke, even with tears, of <persName>her new father's</persName> goodness to her and to <persName>Susan.</persName> She would fetch the cake and wine herself, and would gather, in spite of all remonstrance, some of her choicest <rs type="flora">flowers</rs> as a parting nosegay. She did, indeed, just hint at her troubles with <persName>visitors</persName> and <persName>servants,</persName>—how strange and sad it was! seemed distressed at ringing the bell, and visibly shrank from the sound of a double knock. But, in spite of these calamities, <persName>Hannah</persName> is a happy woman. The double rap was <persName>her husband's;</persName> and the glow on her cheek, and the smile of her lips and eyes when he appeared, spoke more plainly than ever, <said>"Any where with him!"</said></p></div></body><back/></text></TEI>
