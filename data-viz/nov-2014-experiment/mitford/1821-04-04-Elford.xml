To think of your expecting a letter at <placeName ref="#Oakhampton_House">Oakhampton House</placeName>! Well you shall get one at <placeName ref="#Bickham_village">Bickham</placeName> instead for if you do not leave it till the <date when="1821-04-04">4th</date> I shall have time to catch you &amp; I wish to explain to you all my thoughts &amp; feelings respecting these letters. I should be as glad as you would, my always dear &amp; kind &amp; too partial friend, if I thought they won't by any chance make some attractive volumes. But I do not. There is about them now a piquancy which results almost entirely from saucy criticism on the one hand, &amp; personal anecdotes no less saucy on the other. If I were to publish them as they are would be impossible--everything that could by the remotest chance hurt the feelings either of authors or acquaintances or whoever else might be mentioned must without hesitation be expunged--&amp; I blush to think how little would remain worth reading when this playful malice (excusable perhaps for a lively young woman to write but which she would be unpardonable in printing) should be taken away. With these feelings, I shall persist in my request for a loan of those letters--It seems to me that I may find <del rend="squiggles" unit="chars" n="1"/> bits in them which would dovetail in with great ease &amp; some effect--For instance I want to write an article on <placeName ref="#Richmond">Richmond</placeName>, &amp; if I remember right I wrote you an account of the impression which that beautiful &amp; elegant place made on me when I was there last year.  If you will trust me with these letters I will promise you to look over them &amp; if I find your plan practicable to put it in execution in preference to my own--If not the letters will be just as good as new twenty <pb n="2"/>years hence, even though I should <emph rend="underline">get</emph> them now--for neither my Essays nor the Magazines will be remembered then more than the last year's clouds.  If you should incline to yield to my reasons or my importunity, you can bring these epistles with you &amp; either leave them for me at <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> or bring them yourself here on your return, when I hope we may depend on seeing you at all events.  If you leave them at <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> will you have the goodness to send a line to the Post Office as you pass through to let me know tht you have done so. We must not let these precious pieces of impertinence be lost. I am quite ashamed to have made such a clatter about them. <metamark rend="waves"/>My <title ref="#Fiesco_MRM">tragedy</title> is still in <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName>'s hands--but I am afraid it will be ultimately rejected--Oh I shall never have the good luck to be damned!--<persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName> wrote the other day to my friend &amp; his friend who gave him my <title ref="#Fiesco_MRM">Play</title>--&amp; this mutual <persName ref="#Talfourd_Thos">friend</persName> (who is on the circuit just now) copied his letter for my edification. It was in the first place the prettiest letter I ever read in my life--thoroughly careless simple &amp; unpresuming--showing great diffidence of his own judgment--the readiest goodnature--the kindest &amp; most candid desire to be pleased. I <unclear><supplied resp="#lmw">wot</supplied></unclear> the letter of a scholar &amp; a gentleman, &amp; not the least like an Actor.

The phrase is based on the direction given to small children to lay salt on a bird’s tail if they want to catch it.	 1 “His intelligence is so good, that were you to come near him with soldiers or constables, … I shall answer for it you will never lay salt on his tail.”—Sir W.

Biography

Elford’s was one of the oldest families in the west country; his uncle Jonathan (1684-1755) had sat as a Tory for Saltash and Fowey from 1710 to 1722. A partner in the Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase) which was in existence by 1782, he wrote to Pitt in 1790 offering comments on the plan to tax country banks and praising the government’s general record.1 He was a talented artist, who exhibited at the Royal Academy for over 60 years, and an able scientist, whose most notable work was on yeast substitutes.

At the 1796 general election he was involved in Sir William Molesworth’s futile challenge to the Northumberland interest at Newport, but also stood for Plymouth, which lay about seven miles from Bickham, secured government support and was returned unopposed. The following year he was elected recorder of Plymouth. In his maiden speech, delivered from the government side of the House, 18 Oct. 1796, he welcomed augmentation of the forces to meet the threat of invasion and commended the Treason and Sedition Acts of 1795, which had ‘preserved the tranquillity of the country, and maintained a proper spirit of subordination, which without them could not be expected from a factious tribe of revolutionary doctors’. He was, he boasted, ‘as independent of the favour or rewards of ministers’ as any self-righteous Whig, whatever Fox might say to the contrary of those who supported government. A devoted follower of Pitt to the end, he indeed had little to show for his loyalty in terms of material reward, though not as a result of any conspicuous self-denial. Pitt seems to have taken little notice of him." --></back></div></text></TEI>
