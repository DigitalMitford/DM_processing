According to Coles from MRM diary, letters were addressed to her at Bellevue, Lower Road, Richmond (Coles 26) LMW -->hit my fancy except that one last scene to which it seems difficult to adapt any train of events that should be unobjectionable--free I mean from licentious love, &amp; the lovely boy &amp; girl story which is totally unfit for representation, but of which if I be lucky enough to keep my footing in <title ref="#LondonMag_per">the London</title> I will certainly make a little Drama for that publication. <persName ref="#Hofland_B">Mrs. Hofland’s</persName> story seems the best--I knew from the first that the Catastrophe would never do--neither do I like the sort of posthumous jealousy the triple refined sentiments of the Mother--her character would be excessively difficult to manage &amp;  scarcely worth the pains after all. Now I find on consulting <title ref="#Moore_ViewItaly">the History of Venice</title>that the <persName type="hist" ref="#Doge_F_hist">Doge Foscari</persName> was turned out after a long &amp;  glorious government at the age of 95--which affront rather than the death of his <persName ref="#Cosmo">son</persName> broke his heart. And on this hint I think it will be better to make the <persName type="hist" ref="#Donato_hist">Senator Donato</persName> (for whose murder <persName ref="#Moore_DrJ">Dr. Moore</persName> says <persName type="hist" ref="#Foscari_son_hist">young Foscari</persName> was sentenced) <pb n="1"/> grasping ambitiously at the Dogal Bonnet.  At the beginning of the <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">Play</title><persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Doge_F">Foscari</persName>  may be absent commanding the armies of the Republic--<persName ref="#Donato">Donato</persName> may propose in the Senate the dismissal of <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Doge_F">the Doge</persName> on account of his great age &amp;c--<persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Foscari_Fr">Foscari</persName> may return suddenly with news of a great Victory, detect &amp; overthrow <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/><unclear/></del><persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Donato">Donato’s</persName> faction &amp; reject indignantly the hand of his beloved <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Camilla">Camilla</persName> when offered as the price of his fathers degradation.  This gives rise to a public quarrel between <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Foscari_Fr">Foscari,</persName><persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Donato">Donato</persName> &amp; his son <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Cosmo">Cosmo</persName>--&amp; a cloak found near the dead <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Donato">Senator</persName><del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/><unclear/></del> left by <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Foscari_Fr">Foscari</persName> in hastening from a stolen visit to <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Camilla">Camilla</persName> will be sufficient ground for suspicion in <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Cosmo">Cosmo Donato</persName>, whom I intend to make a bold gallant generous character, &amp; who the<!-- Check letter photo for "the."

Tell me if you think this will do? And pray if any alteration should suggest itself to you let me know it--I am not myself pleased with the scheme--but as I can hit on nothing better I think at least to write an act or two &amp; try if I can work myself up into something like passion. I am terribly afraid of the first scene before the Senate--&amp; still more of the Trial--but I will write an Act or two certainly--though if you should meet with any thing better I would relinquish this immediately. You will see that <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Cosmo">Cosmo Donato</persName> is created for <persName type="hist" ref="#Kemble_C">Mr. Charles Kemble</persName>--I could make nothing of <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Doge_F">the Doge</persName>--an uphill character who has little to do but to suffer--No <persName type="hist" ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName> must be <pb n="2"/><persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Foscari_Fr">Foscari</persName>--Write to me, my dear <persName ref="#Talfourd_Thos">Mr. Talfourd</persName>, if you think he would not--write &amp; stop me immediately--one word would be enough--<persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName> is my only inspiration. Amongst my other perplexities I don’t know whether <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Cosmo">Cosmo Donato</persName> &amp; <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Foscari_Fr">Foscari</persName> should be friends or enemies--Which would be best?  But these things will arrange themselves.  Pray forgive this unconscionable programme of <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">a Play</title> that may never be written.

Oh you must speak for the dear <persName ref="#Valpy_Richard">Doctor's</persName> sake--I am only afraid that the offenders will be penitent &amp; <persName ref="#Valpy_Richard">the Doctor</persName> placable &amp; that it will not be tried at all.<pb n="3"/> You will not doubt how exceedingly we lamented not seeing you--Shall you come to <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> in your way to the Sessions?

My dear <persName ref="#Talfourd_Thos">Mr. Talfourd</persName> figure to yourself my worst hand!--all blots &amp; interlineations--&amp; the dialogue all in a mess!
