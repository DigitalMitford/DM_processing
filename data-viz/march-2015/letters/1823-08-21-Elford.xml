I think however the more of those few dear old friends on whose goodness &amp; sympathy I know I can rely--It is a possession--a certain good--a piece of the exquisite blue sky in a dark &amp; stormy season--&amp; of those few none are so very kind, so fine, so <choice><sic>sympathising</sic><reg>sympathizing</reg></choice> as my <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="letter"/></del> excellent friends at <placeName ref="#Bickham_village">Bickham</placeName>.  Your letter really did my heart good.  I have the pleasure to tell you that the quiet &amp; repose of the country &amp; the entire absence of all theatrical cabal have had the happiest effect on my health &amp;mind.  I am quite well <del rend="squiggles">again</del><add place="above">now</add>&amp; if not as hopeful as I used to be yet less anxious &amp; far less depressed than I ever expected to feel again.  This is merely the influence of the scenery, the flowers the cool yet pleasant season, &amp; the absence of all literary society--for our prospects are not other ways changed--my dear father, relying with a blessed sanguineness on my poor endeavors has not I believe even <choice><sic>enquired</sic><reg>inquired</reg></choice> for a situation, &amp; I do not press matter though I anxiously wish it, being willing to give one more trial to the Theatre-- If I could but get the assurance of earning for my dear dear <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">Father</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#Russell_M">Mother</persName> a humble</p><p>competence I should be the happiest creature in the world-- but for these dear ties I should never write another line but go out in some situation as other destitute women do--It seems to me however my duty to try a little longer, the more especially as I am sure separation would be felt by all of me to be the greatest of all evils.  My present occupation is a great secret--I will tell it to you <emph rend="underline">in strict confidence</emph>--It is the boldest attempt ever made by woman, which I have undertaken at the vehement desire of <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName>, who confesses that he has proposed the subject to every dramatic poet of his acquaintance that it has been the wish of his life &amp; that he never met with any one courageous enough to attempt it before--In short I am engaged in a grand historical Tragedy on the greatest subject in English Story <persName ref="#ChasI">Charles</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName>-- should you ever have suspected your poor little friend of so adventurous a spirit? <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName> does not mean the Author to be known--&amp; I do not think it will be found out--which is the reason of my requesting so earnestly your silence on the subject.  <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Macready</persName> thinks that my set was in great part the occasion of the intolerable malignity with which <title ref="#Julian_MRMplay">Julian</title> was attacked.  They at least cannot call this a melodrama.  My wish is to do strict poetical justice, in the best sense of the word, to both the men &amp; both their causes--but I am afraid I shall not be able to do so, because <persName ref="#ChasI">Charles</persName> is that desperate common place of the drama a King in distress, &amp; <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName> with his enthusiasm his subtlety his wonderful power over the minds of all who approach</p><p>him is the very very thing for the drama--I have nearly written the whole of that part, &amp; the one dear friend who alone knows the plan, <persName ref="#Talfourd_Thos">Mr. Talfourd </persName>, who has been &amp; who is as a brother to me, says that in what he has seen I have far outrun his hopes--you will see at once the tremendous difficulty of the undertaking &amp;even how I sometimes despair of finishing the play &amp; am quite in doubt, whether even if I write the other characters up to <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName>(which I shall not be able to do) it will ever be represented.  I have been obliged of course to have a good deal of republicanism &amp;far more <!-- UNKNOWN WORD --> than I could wish--&amp;the Trial scene, which I have not done yet, frightens me whenever I think of it.  There is a great deal of laborious reading, too, <!-- UNKNOWN WORD --> to the undertaking--What is your opinion of <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName><!-- Chagne this and MAKE SI REFERENCE TO CROMWELL THE HISTORICAL PERSON --> ?  Mine is that he was a man acting under an intense conviction of the justice of his cause &amp; little scrupulous as to the means employed in its furtherance--In his domestic character he appears in the old memorials &amp; letters &amp;state papers which I have been consulting to have been delightful &amp;amiable fresh expression.  I shall give only the short time of <persName ref="#ChasI">Charles</persName> being in Town before his execution--what all varying from history except by bringing in the <persName ref="#Queen_Ch1">Queen</persName>, &amp;giving <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName> a <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/></del> loyalist <rs type="person" ref="#PrincessE_Ch1">daughter</rs>--Do you think I shall succeed?  <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Macready</persName> sys he is sure of it--but I fear, I greatly fear--He himself will probably have no power at all next season since I find they have engaged <persName ref="#Young_CM">Mr. Young</persName>.  But then there is <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">Foscari</title> which provided they do not make <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Macready</persName></p><p>play the <persName ref="#Doge_F">Doge</persName> they are heartily welcome to perform &amp;from <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Charles Kemble's</persName> passion for that play, or rather form his passionate desire to act the hero in that play I think it not unlikely if <persName ref="#Young_CM">Mr. Young</persName> will <del rend="squiggles">play</del><add place="above">perform</add> the <persName ref="#Doge_F">Doge</persName> that they may.  The <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">Foscari</title> is a pretty, interesting, graceful Tragedy--evidently written by a woman entirely free from the faults of <title ref="#Julian_MRMplay">Julian</title> yet in my opinion of <choice><sic>inferious</sic><reg>inferior</reg></choice><!-- Note: MRM might be playing with the use of this antiquated word.  Inferious was word used circa 1640s, at the same time that Cromwell and Charles were living and mainly used in relation to kings and royality.--> merit--not so vivid or so vigorous as, false modesty aoart, I cannot but feel that Play to be--your approbation has given me the truest delight, I am aware of your kind partiality, yet I am sure that you would not tell me what you do no think--&amp;indeed I hear from many &amp; most gratifying quarters the same opinion of <title ref="#Julian_MRMplay">Julian</title>--I mean of its power--especially its dramatic power.  Its faults of plot I am most ready to admit, &amp; hope to avoid in future.  It must have had great power to survive the acting--except <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName> &amp; Miss Foote <!-- ADD SI MARIA FOOTE--> the performers were more fit for a barn than a Theatre Royal--&amp;we had not one new scene--&amp; only one new dress!  If The <!-- FOSCARI??? --> had been brought out it was to have had entire new scenery &amp; the most splendid decorations--&amp;that together with the <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/></del> great superiority of the general cast of characters induces me to hope that they will play it next season--It will not fail I think the first night, it is too good for that--&amp; if it survive that ordeal <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Charles Kemble's</persName> jealousy of <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName> would carry it on to <!-- "Beat" I think?? --><title ref="#Julian_MRMplay">Julian</title>--so that between the chance of that play &amp; of <title ref="#CharlesI_MRMplay">"Charles the First"</title> I begin to</p><p>have a little more hope than I had--only a little.  Once again do not mention <title ref="#CharlesI_MRMplay">"Charles the First"</title> not to any one, especially if it should happen to come out among anonymously--&amp;pray my dear friend if you should hear of any situation that would suit my dear <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">father</persName> do not fail to let me know for that work would be the real comfort to be rid of the Theatre &amp;all its troubles.  Any thing in the medical line provided the income however small were certain he would be well qualified to undertake.  I hope there is no want of duty in my wishing him to contribute his efforts with mine to our support--God knows if I could--if there were any certainty how willingly how joyfully I would do all--but that there is not.  Pray forgive this long detail, &amp;the apparent vanity with which I have spoken of my Tragedies--casting off all the usual circumlocutions &amp;writing my very thoughts--but I have learnt to know my <gap reason="torn" unit="word" quantity="1"/><unclear><supplied resp="#ejb">self</supplied></unclear><note resp="#ejb"> Here a tear in the paper obliterates the last word of the line</note> too well for vanity--my weakness, my impertinence, my many faults.  If I were better, more industrious, more patient more consistent, I do think I should succeed sa&amp; I will try to be so I promise you I will &amp; to make the best use of my poor talents.  Pray forgive this egotism it is a relish &amp; a comfort to me to pourforth my feelings to so dear &amp; so respected a friend, &amp; they are not now so desolate <!-- ? -->, not quite so desolate as they have been.  God grant me to deserve success <metamark rend="waves"/> What you say of say of your own dear family interests &amp; affects &amp; delights me.
