I think however the more of those few dear old friends on whose goodness &amp; sympathy I know I can rely--It is a possession--a certain good--a piece of the exquisite blue sky in a dark &amp; stormy season--&amp; of those few none are so very kind, so fine, so <choice><sic>sympathising</sic><reg>sympathizing</reg></choice> as my <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="letter"/></del> excellent friends at <placeName>Bickham</placeName>.  Your letter really did my heart good.  I have the pleasure to tell you that the quiet &amp; repose of the country &amp; the entire absence of all theatrical cabal have had the happiest effect on my health &amp;mind.  I am quite well <del rend="squiggles">again</del><add place="above">now</add>&amp; if not as hopeful as I used to be yet less anxious &amp; far less depressed than I ever expected to feel again.  This is merely the influence of the scenery, the flowers the cool yet pleasant season, &amp; the absence of all literary society--for our prospects are not other ways changed--my dear father, relying with a blessed sanquineness on my poor endeavors has not I believe even <choice><sic>enquired</sic><reg>inquired</reg></choice> for a situation, &amp; I do not press matter though I anxiously wish it, being willing to give one more trial to the Theatre-- If I could but get the assurance of earning for my dear dear <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">Father</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#Russell_M">Mother</persName> a humble</p><p>competence I should be the happiest creature in the world-- but for these dear ties I should never write another line but go out in some situation as other destitute women do--It seems to me however my duty to try a little longer, the more especially as I am sure separation would be felt by all of me to be the greatest of all evils.  My present occupation is a great secret--I will tell it to you <emph rend="underline">in strict confidence</emph>--It is the boldest attempt ever made by woman, which I have undertaken at the vehement desire of <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName>, who confesses that he has proposed the subject to every dramatic poet of his acquaintance that it has been the wish of his life &amp; that he never met with any one courageous enough to attempt it before--In short I am engaged in a grand historical Tragedy on the greatest subject in English Story <persName ref="#ChasI">Charles</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName>-- should you ever have suspected your poor little friend of so adventurous a spirit? <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Mr. Macready</persName> does not mean the Author to be known--&amp; I do not think it will be found out--which is the reason of my requesting so earnestly your silence on the subject.  <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">Macready</persName> thinks that my set was in great part the occasion of the intolerable malignity with which <title ref="#Julian_MRMplay">Julian</title> was attacked.  They at least cannot call this a melodrama.  My wish is to do strict poetical justice, in the best sense of the word, to both the men &amp; both their causes--but I am afraid I shall not be able to do so, because <persName ref="#ChasI">Charles</persName> is that desperate common place of the drama a King in distress, &amp; <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName> with his enthusiasm his<!--UNKNOWN WORD --> his wonderful power over the minds of all who approach</p><p>him is the very very thing for the drama--I have nearly written the whole of that part, &amp; the one dear friend who alone knows the plan, <persName ref="#Talfourd_Thos">Mr. Talfourd </persName>, who has been &amp; who is as a brother to me, says that in what he has seen I have far <!--UNKNOWN WORD --> his hopes--you will see at once the tremendous difficulty of the undertaking &amp;even how I sometimes despair of finishing the play &amp; am quite  </p></body></text></TEI>
