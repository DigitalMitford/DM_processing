The seal has left an imprint on the top right corner of page 3. The upper right 
                         corner of page is also torn out, perhaps from when the letter was opened as the seal stuck to it.
                         The address page also carries a water mark. In the addressee's address, the first word of the second 
                         line is unrecognizable due as parts of it are faint from a brown mark. The word London in the last line 
                         of the adressee's address is striked through.

               (perhaps cataloging the letters and describing them, or marking them up while
               creating an earlier edition of Mtiford's letters), left grey pencil marks and
               numbered her letters now in the Reading Central Library's collection. This letter is
               numbered "12" in the top left of the first leaf, underneath the opening line, "To B.
               R. Haydon Esqr." In what appears to be the same hand and the same pencil, the year
               "1823" appears faintly on the same page just under the number "12"</handNote><handNote xml:id="rc" medium="red_crayon">Red crayon or thick red pencil. Probably a
               different hand from Mitford's that marks many of her letters, sometimes drawing
               diagonal lines across pages, and sometimes writing wo rds overtop and perpendicularly
               across Mitford's writing. On this letter, a red diagonal line is drawn from the top
               left to the bottom right of pages 1, 2 and 3 of the manuscript.</handNote></handNotes></profileDesc><encodingDesc><editorialDecl><p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the

               spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate
               searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both
               Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling,

It took its name from the King's Bench court of law in which cases of defamation, bankruptcy and other misdemeanours were heard; as such, the prison was often used as a debtor's prison until the practice was abolished in the 1860s. In 1842, it was renamed the Queen's Prison, and later became the Southwark Convict Prison.</note></place></listPlace></div><div><listPerson type="hist" subtype="animal"><person xml:id="Long_tailed_wren"><persName>Long Tailed Wren</persName><note resp="#mq">The Naga wren-babbler or long-tailed wren-babbler (Spelaeornis chocolatinus) is a bird species
