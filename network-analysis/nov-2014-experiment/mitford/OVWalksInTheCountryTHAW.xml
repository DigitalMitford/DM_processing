            <!--MAH: June 20th:: This piece as well as FROST appear to be two parts of the same sketch, "Walks in the Country," I have them as two seperate pieces, unsure how we'll want to show them later, but they should be relatively easy to combine. There will be a similar note in FROST to show that they are tied together.
