                    delightful is a little <placeName ref="#ThreeMileCross">village</placeName> far
                    in the country; a small neighbourhood, not of fine mansions finely peopled, but
                    of cottages and cottage-like houses, <quote>"messuages or tenements</quote>," as
                    a <persName>friend of mine</persName> calls such ignoble and non-descript
                    dwellings, with inhabitants whose faces are as familiar to us as the flowers in
                    our garden; a little world of our own, close-packed
                    and insulated like ants in an ant-hill, or bees in a hive, or
                    sheep in a fold, or <orgName type="person">nuns</orgName> in a convent, or <orgName type="person">sailors</orgName> in a ship; where we know every one, are known to
                    every one, interested in every one, and authorised to hope that every one feels
                    an interest in us. How pleasant it is to slide into these true-hearted feelings
                    from the kindly and unconscious influence of habit, and to learn to know and to
                    love the people about us, with all their peculiarities, just as we learn to know
                    and to love the nooks and turns of the <geogFeat>shady lanes</geogFeat> and
                    sunny <geogFeat>commons</geogFeat> that we pass every day. Even in books <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="OVNarrator">I</persName> like
                    a con-<pb n="1"/>fined locality, and so do the <rs type="person">critics</rs> when
                    they talk of <!--annotate unities-->the unities. Nothing is so tiresome as to be
                    whirled half over <placeName>Europe</placeName> at the chariot-wheels of a <rs type="person">hero</rs>, to go to sleep at <placeName>Vienna</placeName>,
                    and awaken at <placeName>Madrid</placeName>; it produces a real fatigue, a
                    weariness of spirit. On the other hand, nothing is so delightful as to sit down
                    in a <placeName>country village</placeName> in one of <persName type="hist" subtype="ext" ref="#Austen_Jane">Miss Austen's</persName> delicious novels, quite sure before
                    we leave it to become intimate with every spot and every person it contains; or

                    form a friendship with the <geogFeat>fields</geogFeat> and
                    <geogFeat>coppices</geogFeat>,as well as with the birds, squirrels, who
                    inhabit them; or to sail with <persName type="fict" subtype="ext" ref="#RobinsonCrusoe">Robinson

                        <orgName type="person">sailor</orgName>! we never sympathise for a moment in <rs type="person" ref="#RobinsonCrusoe">our hero</rs>'s want of company, and are quite grieved when he
                    gets away;—or to be shipwrecked with <persName type="fict" subtype="ext">Ferdinand</persName> on that other <placeName type="fict" subtype="ext" ref="#ProsperosIsland">lovelier island</placeName>—the island of <persName type="fict" subtype="ext" ref="#Prospero">Prospero</persName>, and <persName type="fict" subtype="ext" ref="#Miranda">Miranda</persName>, and <persName type="fict" subtype="ext" ref="#Caliban">Caliban</persName>, and <persName type="fict" subtype="ext" ref="#Ariel">Ariel</persName>, and nobody else, none of <persName type="hist" ref="#Dryden">Dryden</persName>'s exotic inventions;— that is best of all. And a small
                    neighbourhood is as good in sober waking reality as in poetry or prose; a
                        village neighbourhood, such as this <pb n="2"/><placeName ref="#Berkshire">Berkshire</placeName><placeName ref="#ThreeMileCross">hamlet</placeName> in which I write, a long, straggling, winding
                    street at the bottom of a fine <geogFeat>eminence,</geogFeat> with a road
                    through it, always abounding in carts, <orgName type="person">horsemen,</orgName> and
                    carriages, and lately enlivened by a stage-coach from
                        <!--scw: identify B and S; B might be Burleigh as interpolated from Hannah--><placeName>B——</placeName> to
                        <placeName>S——</placeName>, which passed through about ten days ago, and
                    will I suppose return some time or other. There are coaches of all varieties
                    now-a-days; perhaps this may be intended for a monthly diligence, or a fortnight
                    fly. Will you walk with me through <placeName ref="#ThreeMileCross">our
                        village</placeName>, courteous reader? The journey is not long. We will
                    begin at the lower end, and proceed up the <geogFeat>hill</geogFeat>.</p><p> The tidy, square, red cottage on the right hand, with the long well-stocked
                    garden by the side of the road, belongs to a <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#RetiredPublican">retired publican</persName> from a <rs type="place">neighbouring town</rs>; a substantial person with a <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#RetiredPublicansWife">comely wife</persName>; one who piques
                    himself on independence and idleness, talks politics, reads
                    newspapers<!--tag newspapers and media?-->, hates <rs type="person" subtype="hist">the minister,</rs> and cries out for <rs type="event">reform</rs>.<!--annotate reform(although Reform hasn't happened yet)?--> He
                    introduced into our peaceful vicinage the rebellious innovation of an
                    illumination<!--note what an illumination is--> on <rs type="event" subtype="hist">the <persName subtype="hist" ref="#QueenCaroline">queen's</persName> acquittal</rs>. Remonstrance and persuasion were in
                    vain; he talked of liberty and broken windows—so we all lighted up. Oh! how he
                    shone that night with candles and laurel, and white bows, and gold paper, and a
                    transparency<!--annotate--> (originally designed for a pockethandkerchief) with
                    a flaming portrait of <persName ref="#QueenCaroline">her Majesty,</persName>
                    hatted and feathered, in red ochre. He had no rival in <pb n="3"/><placeName ref="#ThreeMileCross">the village</placeName>, that we all acknowledged; the
                    very bonfire was less splendid; the <orgName type="person">little boys</orgName> reserved
                    their best crackers to be expended in his honour, and he gave them full sixpence
                    more than any one else. He would like an illumination once a month; for it must
                    not be concealed that, in spite of gardening, of newspaper reading, of jaunting
                    about in his little cart, and frequenting both <orgName>church</orgName> and
                    <orgName>meeting</orgName>,
                    <persName ref="RetiredPublican">our worthy neighbour</persName> begins to feel the weariness of
                    idleness. He hangs over his gate, and tries to entice passengers to stop and
                    chat; he volunteers little jobs all round, smokes cherrytrees to cure the
                    blight, and traces and blows up all the wasp-nests in the <orgName type="place" subtype="parish" ref="#Shinfield">parish</orgName>. I have seen a great many wasps in our
                    garden to-day, and shall enchant him with the intelligence. He even assists
                        <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#RetiredPublicansWife">his
                        wife</persName> in her sweepings and dustings. Poor man! he is a very
                    respectable person, and would be a very happy one, if he would add a little
                    employment to his dignity. It would be the salt of life to him.</p><p>Next to his house, though parted from it by another long garden with a
                            <geogFeat><rs type="plant" nymRef="tree">yew</rs> arbour</geogFeat> at
                    the end, is the pretty dwelling of the <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Shoemaker">shoemaker</persName>, a pale, sickly-looking, black-haired
                    man, the very model of sober industry. There he sits in his <orgName>little
                        shop</orgName> from early morning till late at night. An earthquake would
                    hardly stir him: the illumination did not. He stuck immoveably to his last, from
                    the first lighting up, through the long<pb n="4"/> blaze and the slow decay,
                    till his large solitary candle was the only light in the place. One cannot
                    conceive any thing more perfect than the contempt which the <persName ref="#RetiredPublican">man of
                        transparencies</persName> and the <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Shoemaker">man of shoes</persName> must have felt for each other on
                    that evening. There was at least as much vanity in the sturdy industry as in the
                    strenuous idleness, for our <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Shoemaker">shoemaker</persName> is a man of substance, he employs three <rs type="person" subtype="fict">journeymen</rs>,
                    <rs type="person">two lame</rs>, and one a <rs type="person" subtype="fict">dwarf</rs>, so that his shop looks like an <orgName>hospital</orgName>; he
                    has purchased the lease of his commodious dwelling, some even say that he has
                    bought it out and out; and he has only one pretty <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#ShoemakersDaughter">daughter</persName>, a light,
                    delicate, fair-haired girl of fourteen, the champion, protectress, and
                    playfellow of every brat under three years old, whom she jumps, dances, dandles,
                    and feeds all day long. A very attractive person is that <persName ref="#ShoemakersDaughter">child-loving
                        girl</persName>. I have never seen any one in her station who possessed so
                    thoroughly that undefinable charm, the lady-look. See her on a
                    Sunday in her simplicity and her white frock, and she might pass for an earl's
                    daughter. She likes <rs type="plant" nymRef="floral">flowers</rs> too, and has a
                    profusion of white <rs type="plant" nymRef="floral">stocks</rs> under her
                    window, as pure and delicate as herself.</p><p> The first house on the opposite side of the way is the <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Blacksmith">blacksmith's</persName>; a gloomy dwelling,
                    where the sun never seems to shine; dark and smoky within and without, like a
                    forge. The <persName ref="#Blacksmith">blacksmith</persName> is a high officer
                    in <placeName ref="#ThreeMileCross">our<pb n="5"/>little state</placeName>, nothing less than a constable;
                    but, alas! alas! when tumults arise, and the <persName ref="#Blacksmith">constable</persName> is called for, he will commonly be found in the
                    thickest of the fray. Lucky would it be for his <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#BlacksmithsWife">wife</persName> and <orgName type="person">her eight children</orgName> if there were no <orgName>public-house</orgName> in
                    the land: an inveterate inclination to enter those bewitching doors is <persName ref="#Blacksmith">Mr. Constable's</persName> only fault.</p><p>Next to this official dwelling is a spruce brick tenement, red, high, and narrow,
                    boasting, one above another, three-sash windows, the only sash-windows in the
                    village, with a <rs type="plant" nymRef="floral">clematis</rs> on one side and a
                        <rs type="plant" nymRef="floral">rose</rs> on the other, tall and narrow
                    like itself. That slender mansion has a fine genteel look. The little parlour
                    seems made for <!--scw: reference to a painting or engraving here--><persName type="hist" subtype="ext" ref="#Hogarth">Hogarth's</persName><persName type="fict" subtype="ext">old maid</persName> and her <persName type="fict" subtype="ext">stunted footboy</persName>; for tea and
                    card-parties,<!--tag games and play?-->—it would just hold one table; for the
                    rustle of faded silks, and the splendour of old China; for the delight of four
                    by honours, and a little snug quiet scandal between the deals; for affected
                    gentility and real starvation. This should have been its destiny; but fate has
                    been unpropitious: it belongs to a <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#BustlingDame">plump, merry, bustling dame</persName>, with <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#BustlingDamesChildren">four fat, rosy, noisy
                            children</persName>, the very essence of vulgarity and plenty. </p><p>Then comes the <orgName>village shop</orgName>, like other <orgName>village shops</orgName>,
                    multifarious as a <orgName>bazaar</orgName>; a repository for bread, shoes, tea,
                    cheese, tape, ribands, and bacon;<!--worth annotating the food items?--> for
                    every thing, in short, except the one particular thing which you happen to want
                    at the moment, and will be sure not to<pb n="6"/>find. The <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Shopkeeper"/><persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#ShopkeepersWife">people</persName> are civil and
                    thriving, and frugal withal; they have let the upper part of their house to

                    for their mammas,—parcel
                    schoolmistress, parcel
                    mantua-maker. I believe they find adorning the body a

                    <!--the previous paragraph is full of general passing references to multiple people, not sure how or whether give xml:ids to each--><p>Divided from the shop by a narrow yard, and opposite the

                    inmates I shall say nothing. A cottage—no—a miniature house, with many
                    additions, little odds and ends of places, pantries, and what not; all angles,
                    and of a charming in-and-outness; a little bricked court before one half, and a
                    little flower-yard before the other; the walls, old and weather-stained, covered
                    with <rs type="plant" nymRef="floral">hollyhocks</rs>,
                    <rs type="plant" nymRef="floral">roses</rs>,
                    <rs type="plant" nymRef="floral">honeysuckles</rs>, and a great <rs type="plant" nymRef="floral">apricot-tree</rs>; the casements full of <rs type="plant" nymRef="floral">geraniums</rs>; (ah, there is our superb white cat peeping

                    full of contrivances and corner-cupboards; and the little garden behind full of

                    her, the grave romp with her; does any thing she pleases; is absolutely
                    irresistible. Her chief attraction lies in her exceeding power of loving, and
                    her firm reliance on the love and indulgence of others. How impossible it would

                        dwelling house is more ambitious. Look at the fine
                    flowered window-blinds, the green door with the brass knocker, and the somewhat
                    prim but very civil <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#WheelersWife">person</persName>, who is sending off the

                    to marry, or to bury, as the case may

                    is just coming down! It is poor <persName ref="#JohnEvans">John Evans</persName>, the
                        gardener—an excellent gardener till about ten years
                    ago, when he lost his <persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#JohnEvansWife">wife</persName>, and became<pb n="12"/> insane.
                    He was sent to <orgName>St. Luke's</orgName>, and dismissed as cured; but his
                    power was gone and his strength; he could no longer manage a garden, nor submit
                    to the restraint, nor encounter the fatigue of regular employment; so he
                    retreated to the <orgName>workhouse</orgName>, the pensioner and factotum of the
                    village, amongst whom he divides his services. His mind often wanders, intent on
                    some fantastic and impracticable plan, and lost to present objects; but he is
                    perfectly harmless, and full of a child-like simplicity, a smiling
                    contentedness, a most touching gratitude. Every one is kind to <persName ref="#JohnEvans">John

                    unprotectedness, his utter defencelessness, have an irresistible claim on every
                    better feeling. I know nobody who inspires so deep and tender a pity; he
                    improves all aroud him. He is useful, too, to the extent of his little power;
                    will do any thing, but loves gardening best, and still
                    piques himself on his old arts of pruning
                    fruit-trees, and raising <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">cucumbers</rs>.
                    He is the happiest of men just now, for he has the management of a <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">melon bed</rs>—a <rs type="plant">melon bed</rs>!—fie! What a

                        red cottage of the <pb n="14"/><persName type="fict" subtype="int" ref="#Lieutenant">lieutenant</persName>, covered with <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">vines</rs>,
                    the very image of comfort and content; farther down, on the opposite side, the
                        small white dwelling of the little
                    <persName ref="#Mason">mason</persName>; then the <rs type="plant" nymRef="tree">limes</rs> and the
                    <placeName>rope-walk</placeName>; then the <placeName>village
                        street</placeName>, peeping through the <rs type="plant" nymRef="tree">trees</rs>, whose
                    clustering tops hide all but the chimneys, and various roofs of the houses, and
                    here and there some angle of a wall: farther on, the elegant town of
                    <placeName>B——</placeName>, with its fine old
                         church-towers and spires; the whole view shut in by a range of
                    <geogFeat>chalky hills</geogFeat>; and over every part of the picture, <rs type="plant" nymRef="tree">trees</rs> so profusely scattered, that it appears like a
                    woodland scene, with <geogFeat>glades</geogFeat> and
                        <rs type="place">villages</rs> intermixed. The <rs type="plant" nymRef="tree">trees</rs>
                    are of all kinds and all hues, chiefly the finely-shaped <rs type="plant" nymRef="tree">elm</rs>, of so deep and bright a green, the tips of whose high outer
                    branches drop down with such a crisp and garland-like richness, and the <rs type="plant" nymRef="tree">oak</rs>, whose stately form is just now so splendidly adorned
                    by the sunny colouring of the young leaves. Turning again up the
                    <geogFeat>hill</geogFeat>, we find ourselves on that peculiar charm of
                    English scenery, a green <geogFeat>common</geogFeat>, divided by the road; the
                    right side fringed by <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">hedge-rows</rs> and <rs type="plant" nymRef="tree">trees</rs>, with cottages and 
                        farm-houses irregularly placed, and terminated by a double avenue of
                    noble <rs type="plant" nymRef="tree">oaks</rs>; the left, prettier still, dappled by bright
                    <geogFeat> pools of water</geogFeat>, and islands of 
                       cottages and cottage-gardens, and sinking
                    gradually down to <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">corn-fields</rs> and
                    <geogFeat>meadows</geogFeat>, and an old
                        farm-house, with pointed roofs and clustered chimneys, looking out<pb n="15"/>from its blooming orchard, and backed by
                    <geogFeat>woody hills</geogFeat>. The <geogFeat>common</geogFeat> is itself
                    the prettiest part of the prospect; half covered with low <rs type="plant" nymRef="plant">furze</rs>, whose golden blossoms reflect so intensely the last beams of
                    the setting sun, and alive with cows and 
                        sheep, and two sets of <orgName type="person">cricketers</orgName>: one
                    of young men, surrounded with
                    <orgName type="person">spectators</orgName>, some standing, some sitting, some stretched
                    on the grass, all taking a delighted interest in the game;
                    the other, a <orgName type="person" ref="#OVCountryBoys">merry groupe of little boys</orgName>, at a humble
                    distance, for whom even cricket<!--game--> is scarcely lively enough, shouting,
                    leaping, and enjoying themselves to their hearts' content. But
                        <orgName type="person" ref="#OVCricketers">cricketers</orgName> and <orgName type="person" ref="#OVCountryBoys">country boys</orgName> are too
                    important persons in our <placeName ref="#ThreeMileCross">village</placeName> to be talked of merely
                    as figures in the landscape. They deserve an individual introduction—an essay to
                    themselves—and they shall have it. No fear of forgetting the good-humoured faces
                    that meet us in our walks every day.</p></div></body><back><listPerson type="hist"><!--ebb: 30 May 2014: added versions of these from the OVSI.xml file--><person xml:id="QueenCaroline"/><person xml:id="Austen_Jane"/><person xml:id="White_Gilbert"/><person xml:id="Napoleon"/><person xml:id="Hogarth_William"/><person xml:id="Dryden"/></listPerson><listPerson type="fict" subtype="int"><!--ebb: added as stubs to main site index.--><person xml:id="RetiredPublican"/><person xml:id="RetiredPublicansWife"/><person xml:id="Blacksmith"/><!--scw:The blacksmith is also the Constable, so should he be listed as such in a note or listRelation?--><person xml:id="BlacksmithsWife"/><person xml:id="Shoemaker"/><person xml:id="ShoemakersWife"/><person xml:id="ShoemakersDaughter"/><person xml:id="BustlingDame"/><person xml:id="BustlingDamesChildren"/><person xml:id="Shopkeeper"/><person xml:id="ShopkeepersWife"/><person xml:id="ShopkeepersLodger1"/><person xml:id="ShopkeepersLodger2"/><person xml:id="RoseInnLandlord"/><person xml:id="RoseInnLandlordsWife"/><person xml:id="RoseInnLandlordsSon"/><person xml:id="Phoebe"/><!--She is the RoseInnLandlords daughter, named--><person xml:id="WhimsicalPerson"/><!--I am not sure this is the best descriptor, I am using MRM's term--><person xml:id="RecruitingSerjeant"/><!--We may also find that some of these people are named later or described more fully as with the RetiredPublican who is MrH--><person xml:id="LizzysFather"/><person xml:id="LizzysMother"/><person xml:id="Lizzy"/><person xml:id="Mayflower"/><person xml:id="Officer"/><person xml:id="OfficersEldestSon"/><person xml:id="Mason"/><person xml:id="MasonsWife"/><person xml:id="Wheeler"/><person xml:id="WheelersWife"/><person xml:id="Curate"/><person xml:id="Lieutenant"/><person xml:id="JohnEvans"/><person xml:id="JohnEvansWife"/><person xml:id="OVNarrator"/></listPerson><listPerson type="fict" subtype="ext"><!--ebb: added as stubs to the site index.--><person xml:id="Robinson_Crusoe"/><person xml:id="Friday"/><person xml:id="Ferdinand"/><person xml:id="Miranda"/><person xml:id="Ariel"/><person xml:id="Prospero"/><person xml:id="Caliban"/>
