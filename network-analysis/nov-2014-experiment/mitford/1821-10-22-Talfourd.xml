But this is worse than my usual misdoings.  Ever since I gave you my wretched article on <date when="1821-11-19">Friday</date> morning, I have had the consciousness that nobody but you ought to have attempted it--especially that I should not--that being, upon occasion, as obstinate as my neighbors, I should have given the dear <persName ref="#Valpy_Richard">Doctor</persName> a touch of my quality, instead of taking the post assigned me so quietly &amp; really checking my <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">father</persName> when with a much better taste &amp; feeling he tried to get me off.  I only thought at the moment how shabby it would be to turn over a disagreeable occupation to you, quite forgetting that the subject &amp; the <placeName ref="#Reading_School">school</placeName> &amp; the charm of writing of <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> &amp; for <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> would have made it almost as pleasant <add place="above"><metamark place="below" function="insertion" rend="caret"/>as it would have been</add> to you <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/><unclear/></del> delightful to every body <sic>everybody</sic>else--How could I be so foolish &amp; presumptuous! <pb n="2"/><del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/><unclear/></del> When I found by your condescending note how much trouble you had taken--&amp; that you still had another account to write &amp; not for <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName>--I was more ashamed &amp; more angry with myself (&amp; this is saying much) than ever I was in my life.  Well the dear <persName ref="#Valpy_Richard">Doctor</persName> is fitly punished in the abominable badness of my report, &amp; so am I.  I have a good mind to apologize to the poor boys in the next paper for cheating them of your valuable praise.  You must write a Magazine Article to console them.  In the mean time <sic>meantime</sic> I could not resist the opportunity of asking your pardon afforded by our sending <persName ref="#Miss_James"/>Miss James a basket of roots &amp; flower seeds &amp; such underground treasures the announcement of which you had the goodness to convey.
