						history of Venice, and was suggested to the Authoress by an interesting
						narrative of that event in Dr. Moore's Travels. It is scarcely, perhaps,
						necessary to say here in prose, what the Prologue repeats in verse, that her
						piece was not only completed, but actually presented to Covent Garden
						Theatre before the publication of Lord Byron's well-known drama: a fact
						which happily exculpates her from any charge of a vain imitation of the
						great Poet, or of a still vainer rivalry. </p><p> She has now only the pleasant task of acknowledging her obligations to those
						whose eminent and united talents ensured the success of her Tragedy. To Mr.
						Young, for his masterly and pathetic delineation of the heart-broken father;
						to Mr. Kemble, (that embodied spirit of chivalry to whom all that is gallant
						and knightly seems to belong as of right) for the brilliant exertion of his
						powers in Francesco; to Mr. Warde, for the consummate subtlety and the
						commanding intellect which he threw into Erizzo; to Mr. Serle, for the pure
						and gentle pathos of his Cosmo; and, though last, far from least, to Mrs.
						Sloman, for her chaste an affecting Camilla, she is most deeply indebted.
						Nor ought she to omit the sincere tribute of her gratitude to Mr. Fawcett,
						for the zealous kindness with which he superintended the production of her
						Play; and to the performers in general for the interest they took in its
						success. She begs them all to accept her heartfelt thanks. </p></div><div type="prologue"><head>PROLOGUE. SPOKEN BY MR.

Deem not of it worse </l><l>That 'tis a theme made sacred by his verse. </l><l>Ere his bold Tragedy burst into day, </l><l>Her trembling hand had closed this woman's play. </l><l>A different track she follows---Oh! forgive </l><l>Her errors ye, who bid the Drama live! </l><l>To your indulgence she commends her cause, </l><l>And hopes, yet dares not ask, your kind applause. </l><pb n="3"/></div><div type="cast"><head>DRAMATIS PERSONAE.</head><castList><castItem type="role"><role>Foscari</role><roleDesc>Doge of

Of such tools </l><l>Are Faction's ranks composed, not officered. </l><l>Celso, we'll have this Doge unbonneted, </l><l> This Doge who wears his load of four-score years </l><l>Easier than I my forty. He contemns </l><l>Me and my brother nobles: he may learn</l><pb n="7"/><l>To know and fear our power.

Celso, I have here, </l><l>How intercepted boots not, letters from </l><l>Both generals to the Senate. They have gained </l><l>A signal victory; Brescia is freed; </l><l>And Sforza gives the unshared unmingled praise </l><l>To Foscari. We must unthrone the Doge </l><l>Ere this news reach the city; for the people </l><l>Adore the Foscari. Faugh! I am weary </l><l>Of this good Doge, this venerable Doge, </l><l>This popular Doge, this Doge who courts and wooes </l><l>The noisy rabble, whilst the Senators </l><l>He elbows from their seats. And for the son, </l><l>With his hot valour and proud lack of pride--- </l><l>I hate them both. We must not lose an hour--- </l><l>The people must not hear---</l></sp><sp><speaker>Cel.</speaker><l> The Senate hates them.</l></sp><sp><speaker>Eriz.</speaker><l>Aye, but the Senate---</l></sp><sp><speaker>Cel.</speaker><l>Well, my Lord, the Senate---</l></sp><sp><speaker>Eriz.</speaker><l>Fy! I am one of them; I must not tell </l><l>The secrets of the Council. We are not </l><l>So stubborn as we seem; the popular voice </l><l>Finds there an echo; and besides the Doge </l><l>Hath friends.

Why art thou not </l><l>Amazed, Erizzo?</l></sp><sp><speaker>Eriz.</speaker><l>No. It but confirms </l><l>What I have heard and scarce believed.

I sent for cord, </l><l>Servant on servant hurrying, till the kite </l><l>Shrank to the size of a beetle: still I called </l><l>For cord, and sent to summon father, mother, </l><l>My little sisters, my old halting nurse,--- </l><l>I would have had the whole world to survey </l><l>Me and my wondrous kite.

She drew her cloak </l><l>About her, turned her black eyes up to Heaven, </l><l>And thus pursued:---Aye, like his fortunes, mount, </l><l>The future Doge of Venice! And before </l><l>For very wonder any one could speak </l><l>She disappeared.</l></sp><sp><speaker>Zeno.</speaker><l>Strange! Hast thou never seen </l><l>That woman since?</l></sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>I never saw her more. </l><l>After a slight brief search, the wonder sank </l><l>Into a jest.
