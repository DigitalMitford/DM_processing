The lines are NOT duplicates of each other, and if you delete either one, the TEI rules won't fire when there are coding errors in the document. If you DO delete one or both by accident, just go to open a new document, and under Framework Templates, choose TEI P5, and TEI All [P5], and the TEI rules will be back! On the last two or three files I've reviewed from you, I've noticed one of the schema lines is missing, after noting errors that <oXygen/> should have been catching!
   
   Basically, if you're missing one of the TEI ALL schema lines, you're missing the warnings that fire when you mistype or misplace a TEI element: (For example, it's supposed to be listPerson, listPlace, listEvent, listBibl, for example, NOT ListPerson, ListBibl, etc...but oXygen wasn't able to catch that.) 
   
   CODING NOTES: As you're working on backlists, you want to be careful with how each entry is shaped:
   
   <person xml:id="whateverID">
       <persName>. . . . </persName>
       <note> . . . </note>
    </person>
    
    The outermost element takes the xml:id and wraps all the info, INCLUDING the note, inside. Same thing applies for the other list entries. If you've got the Schema rules all on, they should be catching this stuff. Hope this helps!--><!--ebb: I've associated and dissociated the local schema MRMValidate.sch. That schema rule should sit below the others, and should run along with them. I've basically just checked and corrected some coding on this file this morning, and haven't yet updated the site index or tried to proof this one. Putting it back in Box for the moment as a Clean, Green copy, as it was not when I associated the full TEI schema this morning. --><TEI xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><teiHeader><fileDesc><titleStmt><title>Letter to <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William Elford</persName>, <date when="1820-09-30">30 September 1820</date></title><author ref="#MRM">Mary Russell Mitford</author><editor ref="#lmw">Lisa M.
