               </dateline><salute/></opener><p>I sit down with malice prepense to scold you my own dear naughty goodfornothing Friend–-to think of your passing so close &amp; never calling--never writing a line to say you meant to pass--quite forgetting your poor little Correspondent--quite neglecting the white kitten! Oh dear dear, to apply the philosophy of a fair Cousin of mine, aged five upon a similar desertion--"Oh dear, dear, Mans is all alike!"--Well--I can't scold any longer--writing to you always puts me in a good humour, so I must tell you seriously how very sorry we are not to have seen you here, &amp; how particularly my Father regrets being at the very time in Reading, being there all the time you were, &amp; yet missing you. We were forced to leave "the Bear" last summer on account of an election trick played by them which put life &amp; limb <del rend="squiggles" unit="chars" n="1"/>in danger--nothing less than <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1">pull</del> taking out the linch pins from the Gig--&amp; now our anchorage in <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> is at a 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> rate Inn kept by <add rend="caret" place="above">the father of</add>an old servant--"The Red Cow," an it please your worship--thither was your note sent--but most unluckily the host (one Mr. Dennis ?<!-- lmw: Brolyluddery??? --> you know) was not informed of the place where <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">Papa</persName> dined--&amp; after sending &amp; going about to ask all his usual haunts &amp; hearing no tidings of him gave up the search--so that poor <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">Papa</persName> never heard a word of any enquiry till he got your note when he went for his horse &amp; found on going to the Bear that you must be by that time nearly at Newbury (N.B. Poor <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">Papa</persName> in addition to his own disappointment — got very undutifully scolded when he came home for not <pb n="2"/>having seen you--upon the same feminine principle which leads every woman to scold<!--lmw: this word you keep missing is SCOLD! --> people for cutting their own fingers.)--Much as I always wish to see you I particularly desired the pleasure of your company now because we are expecting <persName ref="#Hofland_B">Mrs. Hofland</persName> today &amp; I think you would have been equally pleased &amp; amused by this very acute clever &amp; imaginative woman. I don't know any thing more entertaining than the contrast &amp; between her strong Yorkshire dialect, which has a twang like Cheshire cheese, &amp; the elegant &amp; ornamented diction in which she clothes her original &amp; fanciful conceptions--one can scarcely think that the voice &amp; the words belong to each other--I am sure you would have liked her--she has so much enthusiasm--&amp; fancies she has none--lets her heart out so completely thinking all the time that she keeps it in — claims for herself <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1">all</del> the honours of utility &amp; common sense &amp; coldness &amp; hardness, &amp; is all the while as romantic as eloquent &amp; as nonsensical as Rousseau. She is the very person for me--I like contrasts as you may have discovered--&amp; <persName ref="#Hofland_B">Mrs. Hofland</persName> is the complete personification of Contrast--a living breathing moving antithesis. I do wish you had seen her--&amp; above all I do wish she had seen you--to hear a person one likes &amp; admires described by her eloquent tongue is like looking at a favourite landscape through a <persName>Claude Lorraine</persName> glass--all rich &amp; glowing &amp; sun setty. I do wish she had seen you. <!-- jerks --> Winter --just as I had got so far the heroine of this last page Mrs. Hofland in her own proper person put up her appearance &amp; forced me to break off abruptly--then came your kind letter--then all manner of jaunting about to <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> &amp; to <placeName>Farley Hill</placeName> so that I had not a moment for writing till now (Monday the 15th) when our visitor having departed &amp; all being quiet again I am at leisure <pb n="3"/>to finish my epistle as fast as thick ink and an unmendable pen &amp; a most stupefying cold will permit. Your dear letter I had almost answered before its arrival--I had told you of the lamentations of both your white kittens--the large &amp; the little--These lamentations have by no means ceased--?<!--lmw: Selina? Selima --> the big ones Oh Dear — ?<!-- lmw:  Selina?? --> the small says Miau as often as they think of their misfortune in not seeing you. By the way what shall we do with the fair Persian? Is there any chance that you may come London-ward again this Spring? If you do you <emph rend="underline">must</emph> come &amp; see us positively. (Really I have made a very good pen of this at last--I improve.) If you stay in the West would you like that she should be sent by Coach or by waggon? or How? Or shall we at all events keep her till we meet?-- Miranda is very good to her--there is no fear from that charming puppy-- but her Papa, old Selim,<!--lmw Selim? -->, is a perfect--perfect--perfect --(what is the word in <emph rend="underline">Ida</emph> <!--lmw: underlined, a title? --> to express a He Cat who kills his own sons &amp; daughters?)--he drove the poor pretty kitten fairly up the Chimney the other day over the burning fire --frightened us all out of our wits &amp; soiled your little beauty's spotless coat so that she has not been white since. Selim is banished for this offense--he is never to approach the parlour again. "Love me love my <emph rend="underline">Cat</emph>"--I assure you I take great care of your kitten. <!-- hs: wavy scribble, no text under)--> I congratulate you most sincerely on escaping the Sheriffalty --you have surely done your duty in all constitutional services — as militia Colonel &amp; Member of Parliament &amp; ought to be left to your own avocations &amp; amusements. In such a County as Devonshire they cannot be at a loss for respectable Gentlemen who so far from being "Candidates for non-employment" would consider the Sheriffalty an object of Ambition. Ministers have acted very wisely. I shall certainly grow ministerial in time--especially if they turn out our poor aquatic Member, &amp; give us the fun of another election--for Mr. <!--lmw: Weyland? -->having ??? away as a most glorious ? <!-- lmw:  hate? --><pb n="4"/> will certainly be met by a counterpetition should his petition ?. I must confess (though it is not quite handsome to say so in a letter which I mean Mr. Palmer to address) that Lady Madalina's pension does--rather turn in my stomach--There is no moral sin certainly in receiving a pension--but then he who receives it has no right to set up for such a violent ??--Well--he is a charming man Mr. Fyshe Palmer!  And O hope he means to let Mr. Weyland's petition be thrown out &amp; then give up the 200 again. This is what you would do is it not? <!-- jerks --> To return to where we were at Mrs. Hofland's Entrance. "Winter &amp; foul weather" have kept me so <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1"/><add place="above">entirely</add>within that I have read so much &amp; with so little ?? between as to produce a sort of mental indigestion a loathing of books--very convenient just now when the change from black to colours gives me plenty of employment of another sort.  One of these books was 12 Volumes of Burke's works--No need to say how exceedingly I admired this great man, but may I without presumption, without affecting to talk of that which is sometime thought above a woman's comprehension, say that the admiration I felt was excited by very different qualities from those which I expected to find in this celebrated Orator. In a word I admired his wisdom more than his eloquence. His writings (those especially of his earlier days) seemed to me to breathe the very sould of Statesmanship--wide open--honest &amp; <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1">good</del><add place="above">true</add>--but those splendid passages which are so cried up--that on Howard--that on the Queen of France &amp; so forth--did not please me. They are neither prose--nor verse--They are like Ossian--like Hervey--like Philips--like Miss Anna Maria Porter--Like Lady Morgan. Luckily they are <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1">very</del> few &amp; rare, &amp; the effect of his admirable good sense cannot be diminished by these occasional sacrifices to the genius of his Country--(for if <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1"/><add place="above">we</add> wanted to express Irish Eloquence by one word must not that word be Bombast?)--I should not perhaps have been so much struck with this false taste had I not been first reading <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1"/><add place="above">Junius</add> whose severe purity of <pb n="3"/> style forms such a complete contrast with this kind of grandiloquence.--But if I was disappointed one way in Mr. Burke, I was more surprised in another at missing the inconsistency of which one has heard so much. I do not think him inconsistent--he was a party man ?? ?? ??, &amp; of a party which being mostly in opposition seemed to take the <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1">part</del><add place="above">side</add> of Freedom, as the opposition always must--But from the first to that last Mr. Burke was an Aristocrat--a violent aristocrat--I have not an idea that the pension had the least to do with his aversion to French Politics--I believe him to have been sincere--&amp; though somewhat forced by the opposition to his old friends, somewhat fiercer than ordinary, like a man who takes up a position where he expects to be attacked, yet as little <del rend="squiggles" unit="chars" n="2">un</del>changed as any man in the House--as Mr. Fox himself. All this seems so different from the view that I commonly find taken of Mr. Burke's conduct both by friends &amp; foes, that I must most probably be wrong--tell me if you think so--I can only say that it is my sincere opinion--Then I have been reading some very arousing old writing edited a few years back--Letters selected from the Bodleian Library--Hearne's visits to Reading &amp;c--&amp; last not least Aubrey's Lives <add place="above">(a little softened &amp; purified I believe)</add><!-- caret --> Oh what a delicious painter of mind &amp; body is that worshipful Master Aubrey--What portraits in Enamel he produced, how fresh, how rich, how fine!--Johnson's Lives are but Aubrey diluted--very often Aubrey spoilt. Do read them particularly the Life of Dr. Kettle--the first Lord Pembroke Ben Jonson &amp; Hobbes--but read them all--Why is it that English people in this age can no more write portraits like Aubrey than the present race of Italians can paint portraits like Titian? And yet we are good Colourists--we can give fancy pictures well enough. <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1">but</del> as witness Scott--Miss Austen--&amp; Novellists by the dozen--but we cannot take a likeness--there is no Biographer of the present day who has given any thing like the graphic identity of <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1"/> Aubrey or Isaac Walton to his hero<pb n="4"/>--Boswell indeed has enabled us to paint for ourselves the picture of Dr. Johnson--but Aubrey would have given him in half a page, at one stroke of the pen we should have seen the Lexicographer--I think one reason why we have no Aubreys now is that we do not sufficiently cultivate the habits of truth severe ?? truth--we paint in praise ir in caricature--in oil--or in pasto--led away by love or by fancy--or by naughty wicked wit.--I myself without the excuse of wit, am sometimes conscious that though I say that which I think &amp; believe--yet that memory &amp; imagination &amp; fondness may sometimes give too sunshiny a character to my portraits--&amp; that the ridiculous (my pet dandy always excepted) is not quite so ridiculous abroad &amp; walking as set down on paper.  Having thus fairly given you warning not to believe a word that I say--though I intend in future to be as accuarate as Aubrey himself--I cannot help recommending to you another book which I have read before &amp; you perhaps likewise--Forsyth's Italy--the most amusing--the best written--&amp; shortest of all the books on that well beaten subject--Pray have you read my Lady Morgan's Florence Macarthy? And what do you think of it?  And how do you like the Dramatis Personae Buonaparte &amp; Lord Byron, Mr. Croker, Lady Morgan, &amp; the mad schoolmaster? Altogether the medley is such as Master Peter's puppets exhibited after Don ?? had <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1">knocked</del><add place="above">hacked</add> them to pieces--about as valuable &amp; nearly as well arranged. There are glimmerings of talent too about Lady Morgan, &amp; if she would but abstain from Ireland (I would not trust her so near as Holyhead) keep clear from Ireland &amp; Irish politics old &amp; new--be content with English &amp; abstain from French latin &amp; Italian good or bad--but especially from bad (Mem. (as Aubrey says) I don't mean to ?? her to <emph rend="underline">good</emph> English--that would too barbarous)--&amp; above <pb n="5"/> all if she would engage never to have any thing to say of Napoleon (I can't bear her dragging him <!-- squiggles -->in between Punch &amp; his Wife)--if she would do all this &amp;write only a VOlume a year--why then one might really read her books from end to end--&amp; say if people asked "How do you like it?" Why the book is decent."--I wonder whether she would box my ears if you were to tell her what I say! <!-- jerks --></p><p>You do not in your kind short letter mention what I told you of my dear Miss James (I never overpraised her)--but I am so sure of your goodness that I have ventured to trouble you with a copy of the terms &amp;c which Miss Susan James has just sent me, &amp; which you may perhaps have the goodness to give to any one who is likely to recommend her.  Observe my dear Friend that I do not wish to encroach on your goodness by making you an Advertiser of Miss James's school, but merely to ?? that if any one likely to place a young lady  <!-- near Town --> should <!-- torn. apply --> to you, that you will give her the countenance of your <!-- torn. ?? --> I am sure she would never disappoint the hopes of any Parent. <!-- jerks --> We trust that you found Mr. Elford much better than you feared--Write soon &amp; give me an excellent account of yourself.--Your must write soon &amp; long--Think how much we have been disappointed by not seeing you.--Papa &amp; Mama beg their kindest remembrances &amp; I am ever my dear Sir William </p><closer><lb/>most faithfully &amp; affectionately your's

We are likely to have some selections printed in great style at  Reading--Mr. Milman, whose taste &amp; genius fit him so exactly for an Editor of such gems &amp; who has the wide range of Mr. ?? library, has been lucky enough to find a Curate ready placed who <pb n="6"/> is equally qualified for the mechanical part of printing--so they are going to ?? a private press &amp; fall to printing ding dong. I am glad of this.--I have abused our stupid &amp; independent Town so long that I have worn out all condemning phrases, &amp; shall be delighted with the novelty of saying civil things on the subject. Besides I like a printing press--my Friend Mr. Dickinson has one at Farley Hill where I ?? ?? of the Printer's Devil.  Only think of my not knowing Mr. Milman yet. Papa won;'t call on him, say all I can.  Pray excuse this very stupid letter--It is all my cold's fault, which makes me feel as if the place where the brains ought to be were filled up with lead.--The little white kitten sends love &amp; duty.--Adieu my dear friend --Pray write soon--I am going to bed--Good night--God bless You </p><closer><address><pb n="6"/><addrLine><placeName ref="#London_city">London</placeName><date when="1819-02-17"/>February Seventeen</addrLine><addrLine>1819</addrLine><addrLine><persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William Elford</persName> Bart</addrLine><addrLine><placeName ref="#Bickham_village">Bickham</placeName></addrLine><addrLine><placeName ref="#Plymouth_city">Plymouth</placeName></addrLine><addrLine><persName ref="#Palmer_CF">CFPalmer</persName></addrLine></address></closer></div></body><back/></text></TEI>
