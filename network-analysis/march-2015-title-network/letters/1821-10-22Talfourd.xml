But this is worse than my usual misdoings.  Ever since I gave you my wretched article on <date when="1821-11-19">Friday</date> morning, I have had the consciousness that nobody but you ought to have attempted it--especially that I should not--that being, upon occasion, as obstinate as my neighbors, I should have given the dear <persName ref="#Valpy_Richard">Doctor</persName> a touch of my quality, instead of taking the post assigned me so quietly &amp; really checking my <persName ref="Mitford_Geo">father</persName> when with a much better taste &amp; feeling he tried to get me off.

Well the dear <persName ref="#Valpy_Richard">Doctor</persName> is fitly punished in the abominable badness of my report, &amp; so am I.  I have a good mind to apologize to the poor boys in the next paper for cheating them of your valuable praise.  You must write a Magazine Article to console them.  In the mean time <choice><reg resp="#lmw">meantime</reg></choice> I could not resist the opportunity of asking your pardon afforded by our sending <persName ref="#Miss_James">Miss James</persName> a basket of roots &amp; flower seeds &amp; such underground treasures the announcement of which you had the goodness to convey.
