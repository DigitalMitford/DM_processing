You must come--the nightingales will never fail us in such beautiful weather--&amp; in that you must come either going or coming. Let me know two days before that I may be sure to be at home--two days are necessary because our Post boy is sometimes not here till long after we have ridden out--&amp; if you do not come in your journey to <placeName ref="#London_city">Town</placeName> tell me where you shall be when there--that if I should (as may possibly happen) be in <placeName ref="#London_city">London</placeName> I may let you know. Of course we should be very happy to see your friend with the magnificant name--Mr. Champer--Champern. <!-- lmw:  Could it be Champernowne?  That was the closest thing I could find that was a surname. -->(you have written this name as badly as ever I wrote) Mr. <!-- lmw: unclear:  Champernouse? Champernowne?--> with you. You will prepare him for our homely ways. But you must come either upwards or downwards. <!--tlh: **jerk** --> You are more candid to your enemies than I am to my <pb n="2"/>Friends--(political friends &amp; Enemies I mean) but thats not saying much--candour's not my forte. Your account of <persName ref="#Northmore_Thos">Mr. Northmore</persName> is charity itself. I think much the better of him for what you say--&amp; probably Absence, like distance in a landscape has tended to soften down the rugged points &amp; glaring hues of his character. <persName ref="#Northmore_Thos">Mr. Northmore</persName> is much better calculated for recollected than a present friend. This is my last word of him--perhaps the last word would have been saucier still had Washington made its appearance--but as that <!-- "Heroic in Tens" --> (as <persName>Mr. Bellamy the Milk-man</persName> once advised me to construct out of the <title>book of Ruth</title>) has not yet arrived here for me to yawn &amp; stretch &amp; pity myself over &amp; try to praise--why I can afford to be charitable enough. <!--tlh: **jerk** --> Upon my honour you had never before told me the story of <persName>Mr. Marriott</persName>--I would not have lost for "all the worlds one ever has to give"<!-- lmw:  write footnote.  Quotation from Austen, Emma, ch. 28 -->--It is admirable. Is not somebody with such supernatural pretentions mentioned in one of the periodical papers? I think <title>the Spectator</title>. In <persName>Mr. Mariott</persName>'s case I apprehend the addresses first sent deterred him from exerting his powers--he might very willingly have accomodated some ready believer--some cullible <!--lmw: maybe needs footnote, means easily deceived. -->Squire or Squiress--but when he found he had to do with an acute &amp; sceptical man of wit (I hope you let me tell this truth) then he drew in his horns--There is in the new &amp; delightful volume of <title>Clarke's Travels in Sweden, Norway &amp; so forth</title> an anecdote of a Baron who professed Animal Magnetism which quite confirms my idea--he was pressed to show off by <persName>Dr. Clarke</persName> &amp; <persName>Signor Acerbi</persName> (the other great Northern Traveller) &amp; performed very sucessfully upon the led Itallian &amp; the led Englishman Messieurs Lucetti &amp; Cripps, but utterly failed when he attempted their shrewd &amp; wary leaders. Depend upon it if you had sent letters addressed to some Mr. Smith or Miss Brown, or <pb n="3"/>even to <emph rend="underline">J.

Do tell me if you ever hear<del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1">of</del> any more of this curious affair. Is he the <persName>Mr. Marriott</persName>, <persName ref="#Scott_Wal">Walter Scott</persName>'s friend to whom one of the letters between the Cantos of <title>Marmion</title> are addressed? He was a clergyman and went to live in <placeName ref="#Devonshire_county">Devonshire</placeName>--You will see that I have recovered my appetite for reading--I have been quite delighted with <persName>Dr. Clarke</persName> as I told you--very much amused with <title>"Tom Crib's Memorial"</title> <!--lmw reference is to Tom Crib's Memorial to Congress (1818) by Thomas Moore (pseudo.

I intend to treat the public with a 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> Volume of Walpolian letters--a little later in point of time--&amp; dated not from <placeName>Strawberry Hill</placeName> but from <placeName ref="#Devonshire_county">Devonshire</placeName>--I shall leave out names &amp; <del rend="squiggles" unit="word" n="1">charges</del> places &amp; I have no doubt of taking in the whole "Reading Public"--Edinburgh &amp; Quarterly Reviewers not excepted. How do you like my plan? Shall you apply for an Injunction to the <persName>Chancellor</persName> to stop the publication? Seriously, my dear <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William</persName>, the resemblance in style, in playfulness, in humour, in Tact, is so perfect that if ever your letters should be printed anonymously I am sure they would be attributed to <persName>Horace Walpole</persName>. People would miss a little of our honurable Friends small talk to be sure, &amp; a great deal his selfishness &amp; coldness, but in every other respect they <metamark rend="caret" place="below" function="insertion"/><add place="above">are</add> as much alike as <persName ref="#Sebastian_TN">Sebastian</persName> was to <persName ref="#Viola_TN">Viola</persName>. <!-- *jerk* --> I am very much obliged to you for your kindness respecting the poor <orgName ref="#Hoflands">Hoflands</orgName>--things are very bad at <placeName ref="#Whiteknights">Whiteknights</placeName>--I don't think they will ever get anything but the sale of those 50 copies--for the Chancellor has no respect for the Arts--&amp; <persName>the Duke</persName>'s <!--lmw:  Duke of Marlborough  -->vanity will now be as much mortified by <del rend="squiggle" unit="word" n="1">at</del><add place="above">by</add> this Catalogue &amp; description of of pictures &amp; books which are there no longer as it would once have been gratified. Nothing can be more pitiable than this loss to <persName ref="#Hofland_TC">Mr. Hofland</persName>. They are excellent people--with regard to <persName ref="#James_Miss">Miss James</persName> all my eloquence was quite unnecessary for they have relinquished the plan--At least as I understand from a letter I have just received from her--the only silly letter I suppose she ever wrote in her life, in which meaning to tell things delicately to avoid all vulgar mention of Governess-ships <pb n="5"/>Schools, money &amp; such vulgar things she is as obscure as one of <persName>Lord Castlereagh</persName>'s explanations.  I am quite glad to have detected this sweet but too perfect creature in such a silly <!-- unclear Missy? --> fault. It seems like animating Pygmalion's Statue &amp; bringing the Charmer from her Pedestal to one's own level. <!-- jerks --> Our <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">M.P.</persName> is to make his triumphal entry into <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> next <date when="1819-04-13">Tuesday</date>--in a grand procession--masculine &amp; feminine. Pray is it common for ladies to make part of the Cortege on such an occasion? I thought the Etiquette was to stand at windows &amp; in balconies waving handkerchiefts &amp; looking as pretty as possible--However the present plan is that ladies (<persName ref="#Palmer_Mad">Lady Madalina</persName> included) are to fill all manner of Barouches Curricles Postchaises Gigs &amp; Carts--(to say nothing of the Pedestrian Elegantes) &amp; to make in this way the Tour of our independent Borough.

Well it is one step toward consistency to see the inconsistency of others--&amp; another not to ride behind the pension--which I don't intend to do--having the offer of a most convenient window &amp; being something of the dear King's mind who told Sir W. Beechey<!-- Sir William Beechey (1753-1839) --> (vide <persName ref="#Holcroft">Holcroft</persName>'s Memoirs) "That he envied him the right of a Procession to <!-- unclear -->, he being able to see nothing but the back of his <pb n="6"/> Coachman."--Papa who was very unpolitely looking over my shoulder <metamark rend="caret" place="below" function="insertion"/><add place="above">has just</add> told me as I turned the page that the plan was altered &amp; after being advertised in handbills &amp; <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> papers, ladies were not to go--because they could only muster <emph rend="underline">4</emph> or <emph rend="underline">5</emph> handsome carriages--so that the procession is now to be almost all mounted &amp; all male, &amp; the ladies are to look on--Really we patriots are so poor its quite shocking.--You will not suspect me of having fabricated this story of the ladies' procession in order to fill up a page--My credit for <!-- unclear --> in nonsense stands so high with you that I have no fear of that accusation.--<!-- jerks --> Adieu my dear Friend--Kindest regards from Papa &amp; Mama--Write soon--&amp; above all Come--</p><closer><lb/>Ever most affectionately your's<lb/><signed><persName ref="#MRM">M.R.
