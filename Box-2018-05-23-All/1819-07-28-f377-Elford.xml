               different hand from Mitford's that marks many of her letters, sometimes drawing
               diagonal lines across pages, and sometimes writing words overtop and perpendicularly
               across Mitford's writing.
               A
               red line is drawn from top left to bottom right of each of the first three leaves. On
               leaf four, a red line is drawn from top left to bottom right across each of the two
               text blocks. There is no red crayon across the address text block.</handNote>
            <handNote corresp="#pencil" medium="pencil"> Someone, apparently other than Mitford,
               perhaps cataloging letters and describing them, who left grey pencil marks and
               numbered her letters now in the Reading Central Library's collection. This
               letter is numbered "13" in the top left of the first leaf.</handNote>

            <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the
               end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s
               spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate
               searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both
               Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling,
               following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and
               ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

            <p>It is not from laziness believe me, my dear Friend, that I have sent your four lines unaltered. I have been altering them all the morning--turning &amp; twisting them twenty different ways--&amp; on an impartial survey of the several readings am convinced that your version is much the best. Mine all look <emph rend="underline">patched</emph>. Indeed I write verses so seldom now that I have lost the little power I once possessed. The reason of my not sending you any of my attempts is, that I fear your modesty or your politeness might tempt you to prefer my bad lines to your good ones &amp; I would not put such a risk in your way. Surely the last line is very <del rend="squiggles" n="1" unit="word"><unclear/></del> good--the repetition strengthens it. In addition to the greater clearness of these last verses which we both prefer, they remind me much less of those in <title ref="#Manfred_play">Manfred</title> for which you know I took the first you sent me, &amp; as your Picture though strikingly coinciding in subject with this fine conception of <persName ref="#Byron">Lord Byron</persName>'s is not taken from it--has I suppose neither the cascade-rainbow nor the Alpine scenery of his Drama you would of course not wish your nymph to be confounded with the <persName ref="#Witch_Alps">"Witch of the Alps."</persName></p><metamark rend="jerks"/><p>Now that our something like business is dispatched, let me thank you a thousand times for your charming letter &amp; all its kindness.
