The movement and its supporters took their name from the People's Charter (1838), a statement of their political aims. The movement aimed to achieve six reforms, largely through constitutional methods, including the presentation of petitions to the House of Commons signed by millions of citizens. The reforms included: 1)universal manhood suffrage for those age 21 and above, eliminating the property ownership requirement for male voters, 2)vote by secret ballot, eliminating the publication of votes 3)elimination of the property requirement for Members of Parliament, 4)payment for service as a Member of Parliament, making office-holding financially feasible for those without independent incomes, 5)redrawing constituency boundaries to ensure that each M.P. represented the same number of voters, equalizing constituencies and eliminating so-called rotten boroughs, and 5)annual parliamentary elections, aimed at decreasing the practice of bribing or intimidating voters.</note>

Puritans were not a single religious sect with a unified theological or political viewpoint. In the early 17th century, they allied themselves with Scottish Presbyterians and with English parliament members who opposed the royal perogative. They came to power after the first English Civil War and the majority of Puritan clergy left the Church of England after the Restoration to practice as nonconformists/dissenters.</note>

Becket was murdered by four knights while at prayer in Canterbury Cathedral. The king had reportedly been heard to ask the four knights "Will no one rid me of this meddlestome priest?," thereby calling for Becket's assassination without literally ordering it. Becket was canonized by the Roman Catholic Church as a saint in 1173.</note>

                <note resp="#rnes">A Cambridge-educated Parliamentarian leader of Puritan convictions during the English Civil Wars, Hutchinson subsequently participated in the trial of Charles I and signed his death warrant, thereby becoming a regicide. The husband and biographical subject of the writer Lady Lucy Hutchinson, Hutchinson escaped execution for regicide under suspicious circumstances apparently engineered by his wife. However, he was arrested in 1663 for allegedly plotting against King Charles II and died in prison. The extremely belated publication of Lucy Hutchinson's Memoirs of the Life of Colonel Hutchinson (1806) made him posthumously famous.</note>

Her works include the first complete English translation of Lucretius's controversial Epicurean poem De Rerum Natura (in ms. only until 2012), the epic poem Order and Disorder, which has been read as a proto-feminist take on Genesis that invites comparison with her contemporary John Milton's Paradise Lost, and her Memoir of the Life of Colonel John Hutchinson, a biography of her husband that brings to life the drama of the Civil Wars and the idealism of the Puritans, particularly for religious liberty and republican government. This work, published in 1806, is the only Lucy Hutchinson composition that was known as such during <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName>'s lifetime.</p>
                   <p>Born Lucy Apsley, the daughter of Sir Allen Apsley, Lieutenant of the Tower of London. In 1638 she fell mutually in love with and married Sir John Hutchinson. While he fought on the Parliamentarian side in the English Civil Wars, she provided material assistance, at one point contriving for her brother-in-law (Hutchinson's brother) to pose as him while the real Colonel Hutchinson escaped arrest by the Royalists. At the <rs type="event" ref="#Restoration">Restoration</rs>, she may have saved his life by forging an apologetic letter that he might have been more reticent to write.</p>
                   <p>As the critic Devoney Looser has shown, Lucy Hutchinson became an extremely well-known figure during the nineteenth century, featuring as a heroine in many works of fiction and drama.</p></note>

                <note resp="#rnes">Contemporary British playwright, most famous for the deeply controversial drama The Romans in Britain (1980), a historical allegory that critiqued the British occupation of Northern Ireland by paralleling it with the Roman Invasion and depicted rape in the context of war. He also wrote 55 Days (2012), a dramatization of the events between the New Model Army's conquest of London and the execution of Charles I. The original production, at London's Hampstead Theatre, starred the writer Mark Gatiss as Charles and Douglas Henshall as Oliver Cromwell. Modern costumes (in the original production) and language support this play's promotion of contemporary British consideration of a republican political reformation, a possibility later explored far more directly in Mike Bartlett's play King Charles III, which premiered at the Almeida Theatre in 2017.</note>

                 <note resp="#lmw">A series of conflicts between British <orgName ref="#Parliamentarians">Parliamentarian</orgName>, supporters of <persName ref="#Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</persName>, and Royalists, supporters of Stuart King <persName ref="#ChasI">Charles I</persName>, fought between 1642 and 1651. Also called The Great Rebellion or The War of Three Kingdoms, as civil war broke out in all three Stuart kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The war was fought principally over the questions of government (the relation between the monarch and Parliament, as defined through England's constitutional framework) and religion (the Church of England's monopoly on Christian worship in England). The first war ended with a Parliamentarian victory at Naseby in 1645 and resulted in the creation of the <orgName ref="#New_Model_Army">New Model Army</orgName> and an alliance between the Parliamentarians and the Scottish Covenanters. The second ended with a Parliamentary victory at Preston and culminated with the execution of <persName ref="#ChasI">Charles I</persName> in 1649.

The period that followed (1653 to 1660) is called the Protectorate. "An Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth" by the Rump Parliament called the republic into existence on May 19, 1649. Under the Commonwealth, decision-making power was held by Parliament and by a Council of State. Some refer to the entire period from 1649 to 1660 as the Commonwealth.</note>

                 <note resp="#rnes">A short-period comet visible to the naked eye from earth, it appears every 74 to 79 years. In 1705, it was named for the English astronomer Edmond Halley, who correctly identified its periodic recurrence. Records exist dating the comet's appearance back to at least 240 B.C. The comet had been visible from England in 1066 when William the Conqueror's victory founded the modern English dynasty; it is depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry's representation of the Battle of Hastings. <persName ref="#Chas1_MRM">Mitford's character of Charles I</persName> associates the comet with cataclysmic regime change.</note>
