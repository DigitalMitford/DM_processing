            <p> I have just this moment received your 
               most kind &amp; entertaining letter, <rs type="person" ana="Elford">my dear friend</rs> , &amp; I hasten 
               to answer it on the full gallop that I may catch our flying                   
               M.P.<persName>Mr <sic>Fysh </sic><corr>Fyshe</corr>Palmer</persName><!-- looks like it was supposed to be written Fyshe - hard to tell if she left 'e' off as misspelling or bad writing --> - who was in Reading yesterday &amp;<unclear><supplied>ink blot</supplied></unclear> <!-- how do you code an ink blot (it's a blot, not written...) --> 
               (Deuce take that blot - more haste worse speed!)  our moveable
               <rs type="person" ana="Fyshe Palmer">Member</rs> who was in Reading yesterday &amp; <emph rend="underline">therefore</emph> will not be 
               there tomorrow. First let me express how unfeignedly sorry 
               I am - we are - for the sickness you have had to encounter at <placeName>Birkham</placeName> - I hope this will find your daughter recovering both her
               strength &amp; her looks - &amp; that your cough will disappear in this
               mild weather - melt &amp; go off like the snow. <rs type="person">Mama</rs> &amp; I have kept
               quite well this unhealthy winter - <rs type= "person">Papa</rs> has not - he has had a 
               great deal of <sic>head ach</sic><corr>headache</corr> &amp; heavy cold - &amp; as he takes no manner
               of care of himself - comes down from <placeName>London</placeName> at <time>four <sic>oclock</sic><corr>o'clock</corr></time> in the
               morning on the outside of a coach - &amp; other tendencies of the same 
               nature (I hope he is looking over my shoulder) can scarcely
               expect to be free from complaint. M<emph rend="superscript">rs</emph>Dickinson is not yet
               confined &amp; keeps pretty well as to health though a good deal
               troubled with superstitious forebodings which I do all in 
               my power to drive out of her head by gay <unclear>&amp;</unclear> nonsense. Now 
               you have our bulletin<unclear>s</unclear> all round. <gap rend="squiggle"></gap>What you say of 
               <title>Ivanhoe</title> is admirably just and true - <persName ref="#Rowena">Rowena</persName> is a mere
               woman of straw - a peg to hang <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/></del>love upon - as almost all <rs type="person" ana="Sir Walter Scott">his</rs> heroines are - of that horrible old woman I had before
               made dishonourable mention -- &amp; those two scenes of burning
               &amp; of torture are quite unworthy of so great a Poet - He picked
               up that love of representing bodily suffering though, where<pb n="2"/>
               <!-- ??? --> by word syllable by syllable - it is their <emph rend="underline">fault</emph>, that they are of <!-- page obscured in photograph - check in library letter --> 
               Poems the most recherch√©s - Moreover <persName>Madame de Genlis</persName> makes <title>Petrarque</title> out an angel &amp;then says she is just like him! Really
               these French women are vain of their own vanity! - Do you ever read <persName>Miss Burney</persName>'s novels? I mean the lesser <persName>Burney</persName> - not 
               <persName>Madame D'Arblay</persName> but her sister whom I like better. We are
               reading one now - <title>Country Neighbours</title> - pretty enough I think. <gap reason="illegible" unit="word" quantity="1"/> <!-- this should be easy to find in the original -->
               by millions - a heroine who is so young so wise so good so beauti <gap rend= "
               ="></gap>ful <!-- beautiful is split over a line, looks like beauti=ful -->  &amp; so accopmlished that she makes one sick even before she
               saves her lover's life, an iniquity so <persName>Miss-Porterish</persName> <!-- Miss Porter a name or a character? --> that I
               quite wonder at Miss Burney's lighting upon it - the plot too
               is exceedingly disagreeable &amp;entangled - all in a <emph rend ="underline">snarl</emph> as the
               cotton-spinners say, &amp; mighty difficult to undo. But <!-- word hard to read - perhaps eventually? -->
               the book is pretty - there is some good observation in it - &amp;
               a sarcastic old lady whom I like exceedingly - to say nothing of a 
               most amiable old maid - Well I think I have talked enough of 
               novels - Did you ever read a little book which has been lately reprinted <bibl><title>The Captivity of Captain John Knox  <sic>in</sic><corr>on</corr>the Island of Ceylon</title></bibl>?<!-- Account of the Captivity of Robert Knox and Other Englishmen, in the Island of Ceylon: And of the Captain's Miraculous Escape and Return to England in September 1680, After Detention on the Island of Nineteen Years and a Half ???  -->It is charming - If one did not know it to be nothing but
               a real true history told by the very man to whom it happened
               one should take it for one of the enchanting fictions of before - 
               Nothing but <title>Robinson Crusoe</title> was ever so vividly real<gap rend="squiggle"></gap>
               I thought I had done with books - but I find I have not - <persName>Ben
               Jonson</persName>'s <title>Sad Shepherd</title> is a fragment of a Pastoral Drama said
               to have been left unfinished in consequence of the ill success of his
               friend <persName>Fletcher</persName>'s exquisite <title>Faithful Shepherdess</title> - only
               two acts of a scene remain, but they are enchanting - not in 
               old Ben's common Dramatic style, so stiff &amp;artificial - but
               in the sweet &amp; tender manner of some of his beautiful lyrics <!-- an underscore here (looks like "_" -->
               If finished it would have been one of the finest things in the 
               language - the story relates to <title>Robin Hood</title> - <title>Gammer Gurton's Needle</title> is quite another matter - you know that it is the oldest
               English play - &amp; really it is one of the most diverting - coarse
               enough to be true but exceedingly fresh &amp; frolicsome &amp; funny
               &amp; not at all unintelligible - <persName>Miss James</persName> who is <del rend="crossout">by far</del><hi rend="superscript"> one of</hi> the most elegant person of my acquaintance says she likes it better
               than any comedy in the language - one of the characters in it\always put me in mind of <persName ref="#Edie_Olchiltree">Edie Ochiltree</persName> - not in <hi rend="superscript">his</hi> supernatural 
               capacity - <gap rend="scribble"><!-- illegible word --></gap> which you dislike so much - but in his better
               vocation of a merry old beggar - that <title>"Antiquary"</title> after all is my
               favourite of the whole set of Scotch novels 
           
                  
          
               
               
               
               
               
               
               ELISA's LETTER BELOW
               the husband
               was to be she should never <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/></del> get
               him. There was no saying a word after that you know. By the bye nothing but the sort of
               sacred air &amp;that breathes around Bridecake--so that to steal that would be to invade the
               sweetest &amp; amp; holiest of our affections &amp; sympathies--nothing but this fine
               &amp; general feeling could have preserved your munificent present, &amp; brought it safe
               to us. By some accident it was sent not by a Reading Coach but a Newbury one, &amp; found
               its way to Three Mile Cross, after being carried half way to Newbury, through the
               intervention of all manner of men &amp; women--Post boys--&amp; Chambermaids &amp; keepers
               of Turnpike gates. But every thing belonging to such a Wedding &amp; such a Honeymoon as
               yours will turn out right depend on it. You see that your good luck extends even to your
               friends--&amp; travels about with your bride-cake. Oh it will never forsake you! Never! I
               think that last honeymoon letter written whilst the fair Bride was sitting working &amp;
               smiling at your side, was prettier even than the first. Did you read it to her as you
               wrote it? or <pb n="2"/> shall I send her a copy? It was worthy even of that charming
               seal. How much you must both have felt in going into your painting room!--Will the Lazarus
               be finished against next season? If any thing could improve your genius it would be living
               in such a sunshine of love &amp; beauty.</p>
            <p>Miss James is very anxious to have the pleasure of being known to Mrs. Haydon--She
               mentioned your note with great delight, &amp; talked of calling--but was not I suppose
               certain of the time you would return to <placeName><district ref="#Lisson_Grove">Lisson
                  Grove</district></placeName>. She is by this time back again at Richmond. I wished her
               very much to call on you Sunday or Monday that she might leave with you my poor Tragedy
               which <unclear><supplied>I have</supplied></unclear> should of all things have wished you
               to read--indeed I begged her to take the chance--I have such an opinion of your judgment.
               But it is now out of her hands. Only think of my shocking ill luck in having written on
               the same subject with <persName ref="#Byron"> Lord Byron</persName>--The story of
               <persName ref="#Doge_F_hist">Foscari</persName>--I am so distressed at the idea of
               a competition, not merely with his Lordship's talents, but with his great name, &amp; the
               strange awe in which he holds people, &amp; the terrible scoffs &amp; sneers in which he
               indulges himself, that I have written to <persName ref="#Talfourd_Thos">Mr. Talfourd</persName>
               requesting him to consult another <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"
               /></del> friend on the propriety of entirely suppressing my play, which had gone to Town
               to be presented to the Manager the very day that <bibl corresp="#The_Two_Foscari">the subject of <persName
                  ref="#Byron">Lord Byron's</persName></bibl> announced. I rather think now
               that it will not be offered--that <persName ref="#Talfourd_Thos">Mr. Talfourd</persName> will
               suppress it--&amp; I heartily wish he may. <app>
                  <lem wit="#ebb">
                     <!-- App Lemma start: what follows is missing from L'Estrange -->My poor Tragedy has
                     been a work of great labour &amp; is certainly complete enough in its own small way,
                     but it is abundantly womanish &amp; feeble, &amp; does not at all adhere to the
                     literal historic truth--which would be a great disadvantage in case the noble author
                     <pb n="3"/> should have done so, &amp; have made the public familiar with the facts.
                     I hope it will not be offered. What do you think of <persName>Lord Byron's</persName>
                     dramatic power? <title ref="#Manfred">Manfred</title> was very fine certainly--perhaps
                     the finest thing he ever did--&amp; <title ref="#Marino_Faliero">Marino
                        Faliero</title> certainly the worst. But <persName ref="#Doge_F_hist"
                           >Foscari</persName> is a story of real human sympathy--not of factitious
                     sentiment--He will certainly succeed in that. If this play
