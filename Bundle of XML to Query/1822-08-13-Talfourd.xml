            <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the
               end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s
               spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate
               searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both
               Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling,
               following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and
               ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

            <p>This morning brought me your very kind letter--I cannot express to you how much I am gratified &amp; touched by your kindness &amp; confidence--Oh may you be as happy as I wish you!  And you will be so--There are some characters that make their own destiny, &amp; your's is one of them--&amp; who can doubt the merits of the woman of <emph rend="underline">your</emph> choice!  <!-- needs note to Talfourd's engagement to be married to Rachel Rutt.

In the mean time <sic>meantime</sic>your secret shall be quite safe--you delight me by your promise to let us known the day--Oh we shall all drink bumpers to that toast--Out of your own families none can think of it with deeper interest.  What must we be made of if we did not!--The same post brought me your delightful letter, brought another that will give you pleasure too--a <pb n="2"/> letter from <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Mr. Kemble</persName> <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/>that</del>which I transcribe verbatim.  <!-- Transcription question:  MRM puts a double quotation mark in at the beginning of every line in her letter, as in 18th c. print conventions.  Do we reproduce?  If we do, I don't think it will affect searchability, but it will look weird without the accompanying line breaks.

I believe it was necessary to have been as much cast down as I have been to have tasted such exquisite pleasure.  God grant I may deserve it!

I hope you will be in <placeName ref="#London_city">Town</placeName> for I am--we are--so totally ignorant of theatrical business that to see you only for two minutes would be an inexpressible comfort.
