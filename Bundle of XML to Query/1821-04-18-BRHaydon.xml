              Red crayon or thick red pencil. A different from Mitford's, that marks many of her letters, sometimes drawing diagonal lines across pages, and sometimes writing words overtop and perpendicularly across Mitford's writing. This hand has drawn a diagonal line in red pencil down page 3 of the manuscript of this letter.

              Someone, apparently other than Mitford, perhaps cataloging letters and describing them. Page 2 of this letter manuscript bears horizontal cross-outs at lines 1 and 24 of paragraph 2, and a vertical line running down the center of the page. The hand has cross-written above the vertical line: <quote>"Omit all this it is told in the next letter."</quote>
              Page 3 of the manuscript bears horiontal cross-outs at lines 10 and 26, and a vertical line runs down the center of the page. The hand has cross-written above the vertical line:<quote>"Omit all this it is in the next letter."</quote><!--Move and tag this in the body of the letter-->

            <p>I have been waiting till <date>Easter</date> should bring home Parliament then into the Country <!--this phrase is unclear>-->to thank you for your delightful account of your <placeName>Glasgow</placeName> excursion--oh what an honour &amp; a pleasure it is to be selected as a friend to whom you like <quote>“to unburthen your thoughts”</quote>--&amp; how heartily I sympatised with all your feelings whether stern or relenting--I had been waiting for a frank to tell you this--but I suppose indignation is a stonger impulse than pleasure for since I received the Examiner <!--what tag should be used for periodical?--> this morning I can no longer refrain from writing. I had read the article in the magazine <!--identify article and author--> wondering who could be meant--thinking how likely it was I he misrepresented but never for an instant dreaming that it could be aimed at you--of all impossible slanders that seemed the most impossible--&amp; I am even now lost in astonishment at such a malicious falsehood finding a place in so respectable a publication. I suppose that as there is now no regular Editor <!--was not Leigh Hunt the editor at this time? substantiate this.--> the venom slid in undetected. I am almost glad that it did since it has afforded you an opportunity of making a defence &amp; dignified &amp; so spirited--What a necessary thing it is that a great painter should be a good writer! And really in these days when the appetite for anecdote as it is called (that is for scandal) is so <unclear><supplied>craving</supplied></unclear> &amp; the gossip of a set of <unclear><supplied>widowed</supplied></unclear> women over a country tea table wielded in malice to the slander of literary chit chat, every man should be brought to <unclear>illegible</unclear> the <unclear>illegible</unclear> as a weapon of defence against his enemies his rivals &amp; his friends. Do you know to which class the present author belongs?--I will not talk of him any more for it puts me in <quote>a passion</quote>_____<!--a long underline/dash appears on ms--> What became of your <placeName>Glasgow</placeName> culprit<!--identify this Glasgow culprit-->? Did he come back to London according to your behest? And is he likely to turn honest &amp; make his way in the world? I think if any thing <del rend="squiggles"></del> could reform a man your severity of words &amp; kindnesses of <unclear><supplied>wisdom</supplied></unclear> would do so.</p>
            <p>I believe you know my friend <persName ref="#Hofland_B">Mrs Hofland</persName> I have finished <!--a cross-out line is drawn on the foregoing line of text likely in a different hand, thus not marked as a deletion by Mitford--> a letter from Miss <persName><unclear><supplied>Gower</supplied></unclear></persName><!--perhaps someone knows who this might be?--> containing so remarkable an anecdote respecting her that I am tempted to transcribe it--to understand it I must tell you that <persName ref="#Hofland_B">Mrs Hofland</persName> has been for several years involved in <unclear><supplied>a harassing</supplied></unclear> suit on the <unclear>illegible</unclear> of which they had placed great reliance. <unclear><supplied>And</supplied></unclear> <unclear>illegible</unclear> have lost them. What a miserable thing is a <unclear>illegible<unclear><supplied>Chancery></supplied></unclear> suit.</unclear> <!--identify the Chancery suit that Barbara Hofland was involved in--> Now for Miss <unclear><supplied>Gower's</supplied></unclear> letter. <quote>The Hofland suit is decided in their favour--but all the costs being to be paid out of the property not <unclear><supplied>on</supplied></unclear> expence <persName ref="#Hofland_B">Mrs. <abbr>Hof.</abbr></persName> says will come to them. Their lawyer had neglected to write &amp; the news of the decision was brought by a neighbour who told her only that it was decided in their favour--she went to town to enquire <sic>was</sic><!--this is noted as sic because the word "and" appears to have been skipped in the ms--> quite overcome by the information she received--I <!-- I believe this I refers not to Mitford but Hofland or Mitford's correspondent--> was about to mount the outside of the <placeName>Twickenham</placeName> coach to return all <unclear>illegible</unclear> as you may suppose when recollecting she should have sixpence in going by the <placeName>Richmond</placeName> <unclear><supplied>stage</supplied></unclear> &amp; such an one being on hand, she withdrew her <unclear>illegible</unclear> although a most respectable woman with her husband at her side affected to make room for her--Home she came by the Richmond coach &amp; saved her sixpence &amp; her life. The <placeName>Twickenham</placeName> coach was overturned an hour after &amp; that decent woman in whose place she would have sat killed on the spot. The husband had his collar bone &amp; a rib broken. This most striking event gave a new &amp; <unclear><supplied>fast</supplied></unclear> turn to her thoughts--I am sure you will feel as thankful as I do at the detail which she gave. <!-- is it worth annotating for this coach accident?--> in her most pathetic manner."</quote> _____ <!--a cross-out line is drawn over the foregoing text in a different hand--> Having begun story telling I <unclear><supplied><sic>cannot</sic></supplied></unclear> tell you <del>another</del>one story <!--this last phrase is written above the deleted word--> which comes from Germany. The King of <placeName>Naples</placeName> having arrived at <placeName><unclear><supplied>Longback</supplied></unclear></placeName> was desirous to have the amusement of bear hunting which of course was to be provided for him but there being no bears <unclear>illegible</unclear> in the neighbourhood one was purchased of a <unclear><supplied> Savoyard</supplied></unclear><!--tag Savoyard as nationality?--> &amp; placed a few miles out of town in a <unclear>illegible</unclear>. The King <unclear><supplied>exulted</supplied></unclear> at the story went by a train of <unclear>illegible</unclear> courtiers arrived near the place &amp; the bear finding himself in the neighbourhood of the <unclear>illegible</unclear> good company fancied he was to perform as usual came on his hind legs in a most graceful attitude--which alas! had an effect on the hard heart of his Neopolitan majesty who discharged his piece &amp; shot him dead. This story is none of my radical inventions--it came from <persName>Lord <unclear>illegible</unclear></persName> to Mr. <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm"><abbr>W.</abbr>Elford</persName> &amp; from him to me. ____ <!--an underline is draw by Mitford which I take to indicate a paragraph break--> </p>   
            <p>I have a great grievance just now which I have nothing <unclear><supplied>to</supplied></unclear> <!--a cross-out line is drawn on the foregoing lines of text likely in a different hand--> do with, but which I cannot help thinking a grievance nevertheless. The <persName ref="#Wellington_Duke">Duke of Wellington</persName>'s sons are at home for the Eton <!--how to tag an institution?--> They come every day to a little alehouse next door to learn French of a Jew who is lodging there for the purpose of teaching them. <quote>The poor little lads <unclear>illegible</unclear></quote>, says my friend the landlord, <quote>are kept very strict.</quote> They never look up but their tutor corrects them, &amp; there they sit in <quote>my parlour from eleven to half past four &amp; never have a glass of anything.</quote> Without sympathising very deeply in the misfortune which my friend the alehouse keeper with a true <unclear>illegible</unclear> feeling considers as <unclear><supplied>worth</supplied></unclear> of ale. I am quite indignant at the poor little boys being cheated of their holidays. Is it not abominable? A worse iniquity than beating <persName ref="#Napoleon">Napoleon</persName><!--note Battle of Waterloo-->. When they ought to be playing cricket or stealing <unclear>illegible</unclear> or doing mischief or doing nothing. The Battle of Waterloo <!--how annotate historical event? placeName also?--> was a <del rend="squiggles"></del><unclear>illegible</unclear> to this wickedness. The only thing that even <unclear><supplied>looks</supplied></unclear> like the holidays is their mode of conveyance which is generally <unclear>illegible</unclear> in a gig rain or shine. <!--the cross-out line in another hand falls over "in a gig rain or shine."--></p>
            <p><unclear>illegible</unclear> did you get a little letter which I sent to you at <placeName>Glasgow</placeName><sic>.</sic> It is not worth asking for.--My <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">father</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#M_Russell">mother</persName> join in kindest remembrances &amp; I am ever<lb/>

               Were you not very affected at the death of poor <persName ref="#Keats">John <unclear><supplied>Keats?</supplied></unclear></persName> There is another proof of the terrible personality of the age. If he had lived I think his name would have been second only to <persName ref="#Wordsworth_Wm">Wordsworth's</persName> amongst the poets of the day--Indeed even now there are parts of <bibl>Endymion</bibl> which <unclear>illegible</unclear> no other man could have written.</p>
