It owns and has been based at Lord's Cricket Ground in St John's Wood, London since 1814.

                  <note resp="#lmw">The private arts institution The Royal Academy of Arts was founded by George III on 10 December 1768, at the behest of architect Sir William Chambers. Chambers and other artists and architects sought to establish a British national "society for promoting the Arts of Design," a society that would sponsor an annual exhibition (later the Summer Exhibition) as well as a School of Design (later the Royal Academy Schools.) Thirty-four founding members were elected; today, the society elects no more than 80 members at one time as Royal Academicians (Members of the Royal Academy, RA). During Mitford's time, the Royal Academy was housed at <placeName ref="#Somerset_House">Somerset House</placeName>, a building designed and built by Chambers beginning in 1776 and likely not completed until after 1819. The institution moved to Trafalgar Square in the 1830s, to share space with the newly-founded National Gallery, and remained there until 1867. Mitford's friend and correspondent <persName ref="#Haydon">Benjamin Robert Haydon</persName>, was a Member of the Royal Academy.</note>

She and Elford are discussing the merits of Austen and Edgeworth as novelists, and she teasingly asks of Elford, "And will you rank me any longer with your <persName ref="#Marsham_Mr">Mr. Marsham</persName>s? or such unwise scorners &amp; scoffers you dear faithless Correspondent?" Possibly a reference to Robert Marsham, (1708-1797), English naturalist and author of Indications of Spring (1789), a founding work in the field of phenology, the study of the effects of the seasons on plants and animals. Gilbert White described Marsham as a "painful and accurate naturalist," so it is possible that Mitford here pokes fun at such painstaking realism. More research needed.</note>

                  <note resp="#lmw">Hannah More began her career in 1770s London as a successful playwright and associate of David Garrick, Samuel Johnson, Elizabeth Montagu, and Joshua Reynolds. She was a prominent member of the "Bluestocking" group of women following Montagu's salon. In the 1780s, she brought the working-class Bristol poet Ann Yearsley to public attention, and became increasingly active with abolitionists and evangelicals such as William Willberforce and Beilby Porteus, Bishop of London. With her sister Martha, More became active in philanthropic activities intended to improve the living conditions and education of the poor, including setting up "Sunday Schools" to teach reading. Between the 1780s and the 1830s she was a prolific and popular author of novels, conduct books, and ethical tracts, including: Strictures on the Modern System of Female Education (1799) and Practical Piety (1811). She wrote numerous moralistic poems and prose sketches aimed at literate working-class poor audiences, including: Village Politics, by Will Chip (1792), and later worked with Porteus on the series Cheap Repository Tracts (1795 to 1797), the most famous of which is "The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain."

                  <note resp="#lmw">R.C. Dallas was a prominent barrister and judge who worked on many parliamentary and privy council cases, including those on disputed parliamentary elections. His most notable legal accomplishments were serving as junior counsel at the trial of Warren Hastings (1787), defending General Thomas Picton (1806-1808), and representing Jamaican merchants and planters to oppose the 1807 Slave Trade Act.  In 1818, he was appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and was sworn to the Privy Council; between 1818 and 1823 he headed the special commission that tried the Cato Street conspirators, presided over the trial of James Ings, and advised Parliament on the 1820 Pains and Penalties Bill. He served briefly as a Member of Parliament in the Tory interest in two constitencies. He also wrote poetry, plays, novels, and nonfiction works such as History of the Maroons, from their Origin to their Establishment in Sierra Leone (1803) and Recollections of the Life of Lord Byron from the year 1808 to the end of 1814 (1824). Mitford mentions his 1820 novel Sir Francis Darrell, or the Vortex, in her letters. Dallas is perhaps best known today as a Byron correspondent and biographer.  His sister, Charlotte Henrietta Dallas, married Captain George Anson Byron, and their son George Anson Byron (1789-1868) inherited Byron's title upon his death in 1824.

In 1779, she was embroiled in a literary dispute with Hannah More over whether More's play Fatal Falsehood was plagiarised from her Albina (both 1779). Her best-known play, The Belle's Strategem, was produced at Covent Garden in 1780 and continued on London stages until 1800. In the 1780s, she became part of the Della Cruscan circle of poets by corresponding as "Anna Matilda" with Robert Merry ("Della Crusca") and Mary Robinson, "Laura Maria," among others. Della Cruscan publisher John Bell featured her poetry in his literary newspapers and reprinted them in several volumes, including The Poetry of Anna Matilda (1788). Her collected works were published in 1813.</note>

Tasso's life and work continued to be the subject of much attention during Mitford's lifetime. Byron's poem "The Lament of Tasso," written in Florence, appeared in 1817; a translation of Gerusalemme Liberata in Spenserian stanzas by Jeremiah Holmes Wiffen appeared in 1821; Donizetti wrote an opera on the subject of Tasso in 1833, incorporating some of the poet's work into the libretto; and Franz Liszt composed a symphonic poem, Tasso, Lamento e Trionfo in commemoration of the centenary of Goethe's birth in 1849.

                  <note resp="#hbl #lmw">A prolific painter and printmaker, Rembrandt is usually regarded as the greatest artist of Holland's "Golden Age." Best known for his portraits in oil, particularly his many self-portraits, he also painted landscapes and narratives, including biblical and mythological scenes. He was also a skilled printmaker, employing etching as well as dry point techniques.</note>

                  <note resp="#lmw">A portrait, landscape, and history painter in oils, Rubens is best-known for his female nudes of biblical, allegorical, and mythological subjects; he also produced commissioned Counter-Reformation altarpieces. At the height of his career, he ran a large studio in Antwerp, and he was knighted by both Charles I of England and Philip IV of Spain. He used the production of prints and book title-pages, based on his drawings, to extend his fame in Europe, working with the renowned Plantin-Moretus publishing house. In 1630, Rubens married his second wife, Hélène Fourment, who inspired the voluptuous figures in many of the best-known paintings from his later career.</note>

The statue was rediscovered near Rome in the fifteenth century, and restored. The statue was much admired in the 18th- and 19th-century, when the statue was held up ax exemplifying the aesthetic ideals of the neoclassical tradition.  It depicts the Greek god Apollo as an archer. It has variously been suggested as illustrating Apollo having slain the serpent Python, or as slaying the gian Tityos.</note>
