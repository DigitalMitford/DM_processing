The case is very different now; she is still a poker--but a poker of whom every one is afraid. It must be confessed that this silent observation from such an observer is rather formidable. Most writers are good-humoured chatterers--neither very wise nor very witty:--but nine times out of ten (at least in the few that I have known) unaffected and pleasant, and quite removing by their conversation any awe that may have been excited by their works. But a wit, a delineator of character, who does not talk, is terrific indeed!</quote> Source: <bibl corresp="#Lestrange_Letters">L'Estrange</bibl>.</note>

His philosophical works include the Novum Organum Scientiarum (New Organon), Advancement of Learning, Essays, and New Atlantis. A nephew of the powerful Elizabethan politician William Cecil, Lord Burleigh (or Burghley), he served as Member of Parliament for various constituencies at various times, as an advisor to Elizabeth's doomed favourite and failed usurper Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, and as Attorney General and Lord Chancellor under James I. In 1621, he was prosecuted for corruption and barred from further public service. He has been controversially reputed to be homosexual, on the grounds that a fellow M.P. called one of his (Bacon's) servingmen "his catamite and bed-fellow." In 1845 (during Mitford's lifetime), this passage was published for the first time. <!--RN: fix wording and ask Mary Learner (UNC) if this is fair --></note>

Many of these plays are now thought to have been composed by only one of the duo, with or without a third author, or by neither. Perhaps the most famous Beaumont and Fletcher play is the ribald comedy The Knight of the Burning Pestle. Beaumont was also a poet and friend of Ben Jonson. He contributed prefatory verses to Jonson's comedy Volpone.</note>

                  <note resp="#lmw #rnes">Bewick is one of the most important practitioners of modern wood engraving. He is the best-known and one of the finest wood engravers employing a technique (which he did not invent) in which hard boxwood is carved on the end-grain using metal-engraver's tools. This technique allows for the creation of finer and more detailed engraved images and also results in an engraving block that is more durable than those carved with the grain. Notable works of literary illustration include editions of <persName ref="#Goldsmith">Oliver Goldsmith</persName>'s The Traveller and The Deserted Village, Thomas Parnell's The Hermit, and William Somervile's The Chase. His major works as a naturalist include A History of British Birds and A General History of Quadrupeds, as well as a series of editions of Aesop's Fables. One of Bewick's specialties was his tail- or tale-pieces, small engraved illustrations used to fill gaps left by page breaks. British Birds features prominently in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, in which Jane prizes it more for its images than its text.</note>

                  <note resp="#ncl #lmw">Quaker, abolitionist, radical reformer in politics and religion, and an agricultural experimenter in the cross-breeding of Merino sheep, Birkbeck emigrated to America in 1817 in order to establish a utopian community in the Illinois territory. Author of <title ref="#America_Birkbeck">Notes on a Journey in America</title> and <title ref="#Illinois_Birkbeck">Letters from Illinois</title>. These much-read works, which presented a utopian, anti-clerical, and anti-aristocratic vision of American settlement, were believed to be instrumental in encouraging many disaffected Europeans to emigrate to the American prairies, and set off a pamphlet war about on the topic of American emigration to the so-called English Prairie. (See Eaton, Joseph. The Anglo-American Pamphlet War, 1800-1825. New York:  Palgrave/Macmillan, 2012). He became president of Illinois's first agricultural society, worked against the establishment of slavery in the state, and briefly served as Secretary of State for Illinois. He was acquainted with Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Edward Coles, and Robert Owen, himself the founder of another midwestern utopian community in New Harmony, Indiana.</note>

                  <note resp="#rnes">First-generation British Romantic poet, artist, engraver, and religious visionary. Based in London, Blake left the city infrequently and both celebrates and critiques it in his often mystical works. His most famous poetic texts, often originally illustrated and printed by him, with color illustrations unique specific copies, include the collection Songs of Innocence and Experience, Visions of the Daughters of Albion, and Jerusalem, which contains his lyric "And Did Those Feet...", which since the First World War has been popularized as a song. Until the mid-Victorian era, Blake's work was not widely known or was dismissed as the product of mental illness.</note>

                  <note resp="#rnes">Physician, philosopher, and theologian who made considerable contributions to English thought, especially about science, and the English language (including over 700 neologisms), particularly during the turbulent era of the Civil Wars. His most famous works include "Religio Medici" (A Doctor's Religion), "Urne-Buriall", and the extraordinary encyclopedia of pseudoscientific error, the Pseudodoxia Epidemica (translated in 1672 as "Enquiries Into Commonly Presumed Truths.") Browne's writing was admired by many Romantic and Victorian authors, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas Carlyle. The subject of a biography by Samuel Johnson, Browne has lost much of his cultural status since the end of the nineteenth century, but is now undergoing a cultural resurgence.</note>

                     This poet fought on the Parliamentary side in the English Civil Wars and is best known for his satirical burlesque poem Hudibras, which was published in parts in the 1660s and 1670s. Transparently informed by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra's novel Don Quixote (1605), Hudibras features a bickering knight-and-servingman duo and scourges various kinds of hypocrisy. It won Butler the patronage of Charles II, despite the poet's earlier political activity.</note>

                  <note resp="#rnes">The wife of George Gordon, Lord Byron, and mother of mathematician Ada Augusta King (nee Byron), Countess of Lovelace. Married in 1815, Lady Byron formally separated from her husband almost a year later, shortly after Ada's birth. She had left her marital household with her child, having endured many of Lord Byron's outbursts, taunts, and (it has been rumored) rape. She encouraged her daughter's mathematical pursuits, engaging the celebrity mathematician Augustus de Morgan to instruct her. Late in life, Lady Byron was befriended by an American visitor, Uncle Tom's Cabin author Harriet Beecher Stowe, who, after Lady Byron's death, defended her separation from her husband in Lady Byron Vindicated, for which Stowe was widely condemned.</note>

A soldier in his youth, he was wounded at Lepanto during the wars between the Holy League and the Ottoman Empire, and also held captive and ransomed. He is best known for his romance (proto-novel) Don Quixote (1605), but also wrote other romances: La Galatea (1585) and Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda (The Labors of Persiles and Segismunda). This last romance was unfinished at his death. Romantic-period women authors often emulated Don Quixote. Examples include Mary Shelley's History of a Six Weeks' Tour, as the critic Jeanne Moskal has explained, and Charlotte Lennox's reactionary, misogynist The Female Quixote, or, the Adventures of Arabella.</note>

These events are the subject matter of <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName>'s tragedy <title ref="#CharlesI_MRMplay">Charles the First</title>.</p> 
                     <p>The second son of James VI of Scotland, who became James I of England when Charles was three years old, the future king became James's heir in 1612, upon the death of his extremely popular brother Henry, Prince of Wales. As a king, he was susceptible to the influence of his father's ambitious favourite George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, until Buckingham's assassination by a disturbed veteran in 1628. Charles quarrelled with Parliament over matters ranging from finances to control of religion and cultural observances. He instituted a disastrous policy of "personal rule," and in August 1642, declared war on Parliament.</p>
                     <p>After the Parliamentary faction, with its New Model Army, achieved victory, Charles was tried for treason and, declaring himself "the martyr of the people," was executed outside the Banqueting House at Whitehall that had been designed by Inigo Jones for James I. A week after his execution, he was quietly buried at Windsor and the monarchy was abolished.</p>
                     <p>Charles I is the apocryphal author of the Eikon Basilike, or Pourctraiture of his Sacred Majesty in his Solitudes and Sufferings (1649), which was probably written substantially by John Gauden.</p></note>

                     <p>A descendant of the Tudor politician Thomas Cromwell, raised in the Cambridgeshire Fens and educated at Cambridge University, he became deeply spiritual in the 1620s, identifying as a Puritan. (He never called himself a "Roundhead," and resisted others' use of this Royalist slur.) He became an M.P. and, in 1641, attacked what he considered <q>ecclesiastical tyranny and usurpation.</q> During the <rs type="event" ref="#EngCivilWar">Civil Wars</rs>, he commanded Parliamentary forces as Lieutenant-General, second only to Sir Thomas, Lord Fairfax, who served as the Parliamentary army's General. Cromwell quickly overshadowed Fairfax and devised the <orgName ref="#New_Model_Army">New Model Army</orgName> (founded 1645).</p>
                     <p>After the <persName ref="#ChasI">king</persName>'s capture and extradition from the Isle of Wight, Cromwell seemed not committed to the notion of trying and executing the king until the eleventh hour, but ultimately served as a Commissioner at the trial and signed the warrant.</p> 
                     <p>In the aftermath of the King's execution, Ireland (which had rebelled in 1641) developed a Royalist resistance, which Cromwell and his son-in-law <persName ref="#Ireton">Henry Ireton</persName> suppressed between 1649 and 1651. This war resulted in genocide which killed (through violence, displacement, or disease) up to one third of the Irish population; the exact number of casualties and the time-extent of the period are still debated by historians. The period came to be called An Mallact Cromail (The Curse of Cromwell).</p>
                     <p>In Commonwealth England, Cromwell chaired the Republic's Council of State, then, 1653 until his death in 1658, served as Lord Protector, essentially converting the Republic to a dictatorship&#8212;and alienating many former supporters. After Cromwell's death and the abdication of the second Lord Protector, his son Richard Cromwell, the Republican experiment ended with Parliament inviting <persName ref="#ChasII">Charles I's son</persName> to return from exile to be restored as king.</p>
                     <p>Throughout the nineteenth century, Cromwell's reputation was on an upswing.  The trend was towards viewing him as a man guided by devout faith in God, a desire to provide for his country, and a desire to purify the Protestantism in his country.</p></note>

She was the daughter and co-heiress of Humphrey Hall of Mandon, Devon, England and his wife, the Hon. Jane St. John, daughter of John St. John, 11th Baron St. John of Bletsoe. She married Maine Swete Waldron, an officer in the Coldstream Guards, in 1803 and they had two children, only one of whom lived to adulthood. Her first husband died around 1817 and she married Sir William Elford four years later. She died at Totnes, Devon in late 1839 and her will was probated on 10 December 1839. Some secondary sources erroneously give the spelling of her first married name as "Waldron;" however, she is not to be confused with the American Elizabeth Waldron (1780 to 21 July 1853).‏ Her birthdate is not given in any standard nineteenth century reference sources, but is likely to be before 1780.</note>
