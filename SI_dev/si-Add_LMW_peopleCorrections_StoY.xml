                  <note resp="#lmw">In 1648, Salisbury was a member of the deputation who negotiated the failed Treaty of Newport with Charles I; although he did not come out strongly in favor of either side during the English Civil Wars, his estate suffered depradations. He later refused to approve the regicide, although he took the Engagement and supported the Commonwealth following Charles's execution. During the Interregnum, Salisbury served in the English Council of State; he served as Member of Parliament for King's Lynn in the Rump Parliament. Although he was elected as Member of Parliament for Hertfordshire in 1656 during the Second Protectorate Parliament, he was not allowed to take his seat.</note>

                  <note resp="#ajc #lmw"><p>John Weyland was a Tory journal editor and political figure. He and William Roberts founded the Christian evangelical periodial the British Review and London Critical Journal, a quarterly that appeared between 1811 and 1825. He authored several publications on population and the English poor laws, including A Short Enquiry into the Policy, Humanity, and Effect of the Poor Laws (1807); Observations on Mr. Whitbread's Poor Bill and on the Population of England (1807); The Principle of the English Poor Laws, illustrated from the Evidence given by Scottish Proprietors (before the Corn Committee,) on the Connexion observed in Scotland between the Price of Grain and the Wages of Labour (1815); and The Principles of Population and Production as they are affected by the Progress of Society (1816). He believed that hardship was an incentive to industry and he did not support further education of the poor.</p>
                     <p>On <date when="1820-03-16">March 16, 1820</date>, Weyland was the "Blue" or Tory candidate, supported by the municipal corporation, in the Reading election. Three candidates ran: <persName ref="#Monck_JB">John Berkeley Monck</persName> (418 votes), <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Charles Fyshe Palmer</persName>(399 votes), and <persName ref="#Weyland_John">John Weyland</persName> (395 votes.); Weyland was not returned. See <ptr target="http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/constituencies/reading"/>. Weyland later won a seat as Member of Parliament for Hindon, Wiltshire, and served from 1830 to 1832.</p>

                  <note resp="#scw #lmw">Gilbert White obtained deacon's orders in 1746 and became fully ordained in 1749; he held several curacies in Hampshire and Wiltshire. From 1784 until his death he held the post of curate of Selborne, Hampshire. White's most famous and widely-cited book, <bibl>The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne</bibl> was admired by <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford </persName> for its careful observations of nature. The book is cited by the narrator of <title ref="#Our_Village1st_ed">Our Village</title> in the introductory <title>Our Village sketch</title> as well as in <title>Frost and Thaw</title>.<!--scw: I am sure we will come across his name in other sketches-->. An important amateur natural historian, botanist, and ornithologist, he emphasized the interrelatedness of plants and animals within an environment in ways that foreshadow modern ecology. Because of his botanical work, his name has been accorded a standard abbreviation for citation purposes in the <bibl>International Code of Botanic Nomenclature</bibl>
