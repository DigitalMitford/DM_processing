                     Garden and Drury Lane Theatres in London and also toured the United States. He appeared in Sheridan Knowles's William Tell (1825), Byron's Sardanapolus (1833), and Bulwer-Lytton's Money (1840), as well as in many Shakespearean roles. He also managed both Covent Garden and Drury Lane Theatres. In his role as actor-manager, Macready was a correspondent and collaborator with <persName ref="#MRM">Mary Russell Mitford</persName>. The first play on which they worked was Mitford's <title ref="#Julian_MRMplay">Julian</title> (1823). Mitford dedicated to Macready the print edition of Julian: "To William Charles Macready, Esq., with high esteem for those endowments which have cast new lustre on his art; with warm admiration for those powers which have inspired, and that taste which has fostered the tragic dramatists of his age; with heartfelt gratitnde for the zeal with which he befriended the production of a stranger, for the judicious alterations which he suggested, and for the energy, the pathos, and the skill with which he more than emhodied its principal character; this tragedy is most respectfully dedicated by the author." Macready retired from the stage in 1851.

("Mahomet" is also the spelling used by Voltaire in his 1735 play, with which Mitford may have been familiar.) Elsewhere, Mitford refers to "Mahound and Termagaunte" as stereotypically violent Islamic gods; Mahound is another alternative spelling for Muhammad.</note>

Mitford mentions Milman's literary, critical, and editing work in her correspondence and indicates that he made written suggestions on the manuscript of Foscari in 1821. Milman was elected professor of poetry at Oxford in 1821; Sir Robert Peel made him Rector of St Margaret's, Westminster, and Canon of Westminster in 1835, and in 1849 he became Dean of St Paul's. He published poetry, several tragedies, and hymns, as well as translations of Agamemnon and Euripides, and an edition of Horace. He also wrote several important histories, including History of the Jews (1829), History of Christianity to the Abolition of Paganism in the Roman Empire (1840), and History of Latin Christianity (1855); he also edited Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and published a Life of Gibbon (1838, 1839). Milman was buried in St Paul's Cathedral.</note>
