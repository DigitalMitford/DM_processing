                     <p> A West End theater located in Covent Garden in the London borough of
                        Westminster. One of the "patent theaters." First theater on this site was
                        opened in 1732 by John Rich, renovated by architect Henry Holland in 1792,
                        and destroyed by fire on 20 Sept. 1808. The second theater, designed by
                        Robert Smirke, opened on 18 Sept. 1809, managed by <persName ref="#Kemble_JP">John Phillip Kemble</persName>. Because of rent
                        increases by the Duke of Bedford, the landowner, J.P. Kemble increased
                        ticket prices. This led to the "old price (or O.P.) riots" and the eventual
                        lowering of ticket prices, although the proprietors proved they would lose
                        money at those prices. The second theater was destroyed by fire on 5 March
                        1856. The third theater, designed by Edward Middleton Barry, opened in 1858
                        and remains the nucleus of today's theater. The theater became the Royal
                        Opera House in 1892 and the building was renovated and expaneded in the
                        1980s and 1990s.</p>
