THE SHOEMAKER WHO BROUGHT MONCK FROM FRANCE AND THAT NAME YOU WERE PUZZLING OVER IN THE SI NOTE TO MONCK: I believe that name is Mr. Warry, possibly Joseph, and that he is the "celebrated shoemaker". See William Silver Darter [An Octogenarian], who names Warry of Minster Street, "an active liberal," as the person who was sent to France (p.41), although he says it was the 1812 election. I then found a Monthly Mag (Vol. 12, p.174 - Google Books) death notice for a Joseph Warry, boot and shoemaker of Reading, for 1801, which suggests the possibility that Mr. Warry may be his son who took over the business. Coles also puzzles over the name in one of MRM's letters. -->Source: <persName ref="#Needham_Francis">Francis Needham</persName>, Letter to <persName ref="#Roberts_Wm">William Roberts</persName>, <date when="1954-03-26">26 March, 1954</date>. <persName ref="#Needham_Francis">Needham Papers</persName>, <orgName ref="#ReadingCL">Reading Central Library</orgName>.</p></note>
