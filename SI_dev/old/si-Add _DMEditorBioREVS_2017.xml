         <note type="bio">Sylvan Baker graduated with a B.A. in English from the University of Montevallo in May 2017, and will be attending the University of Nevada-Reno for graduate school in the fall. Before attending Montevallo, Sylvan spent a year and a half in Ireland with her mom (who thankfully is living back here in the US now), and she gained a lot of cultural knowledge and a love for the Irish countryside.  At UM, she found a love for studying nature and the environment in texts, especially in Romantic texts.  She has thoroughly enjoyed the Lake Poets and Mitford's connections to the natural landscape in "Our Village.” She worked on the Digital Mitford Archive while enrolled in Samantha Webb’s Digital Romanticism course in Spring 2017.</note>
