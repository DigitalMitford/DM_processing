The 1851 census lists her occupation as "authoress," and lists her as living at Three Mile Cross with Kerenhappuch Taylor (lady's maid), Sarah Chernk (maid-of-all-work), and Samuel Swetman (gardener), after the death of her father. Mitford's long life and prolific career ended after injuries from a carriage accident. She died on January 10, 1855 at Swallowfield, Berkshire and she is buried in Swallowfield churchyard. The executor of her will and her literary executor was the Rev. William Harness and her lady's maid, Kerrenhappuch Taylor Sweetman, was residuary legatee of estate.

He took orders in the Church of England in 1777. Richard Valpy served as Second Master at Bury School, Bury, Huntindonshire from 1771 to 1781, and was also collated to the rectory of Stradishall, Suffolk, in 1787. He became the Headmaster at Reading School, Reading, Berkshire, in 1781 and served until 1830, at which time he turned the Headmastership over to his youngest son Francis E. J. Valpy and continued in semi-retirement until his death in 1836. During his tenure as Headmaster of <placeName ref="#Reading_School">Reading Grammar School</placeName> for boys over the course of fifty years, he expanded the boarding school and added new buildings. He is the author of numerous published works, including Greek and Latin textbooks, sermons, volumes of poetry, and adaptations of plays such as Shakespeare's King John and Sheridan's The Critic. His <bibl>Elements of Greek Grammar</bibl>, <bibl>Elements of Latin Grammar,</bibl>,<bibl>Greek Delectus</bibl> and <bibl>Latin Delectus</bibl>, printed and published by his son <persName ref="#Valpy_John">A. J. Valpy</persName>, were all much used as school texts throughout the nineteenth century. Valpy's students performed his own adaptations of Greek, Latin, and English plays for the triennial visitations and the play receipts went to charitable organizations.

In 1803, his adaptation of Shakespeare's King John was performed at Covent Garden Theatre.</p>

                  <note type="bio" resp="#ebb #lmw">William Elford was born in Kingsbridge, Devon in August 1749 to the Rev. Lancelot Elford and Grace Alexander Wills. He was baptised in Kingsbridge on October 31, 1749. He married Mary Davies of Plympton on January 20, 1776 and they had one son, Jonathan, and two daughters, Grace Chard and Elizabeth. After the death of his first wife, he married Elizabeth Hall, widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Maine Swete Walrond of the Coldstream Guards. Elizabeth was the daughter and co-heir of Humphry Hall of Manadon, Devon, and had two children by her previous marriage, although only her son lived to adulthood. Sir William's only son Johnathan died in 1823, leaving him without an heir. He worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase) in Plymouth, Devon, from its founding in 1782. He was elected a member of Parliament for Plymouth as a supporter of the government and Tory William Pitt, and served from 1796 to 1806. After his election defeat in Plymouth in 1806, he was elected member of Parliament for Rye and served from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service in Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800; after his son Johnathan came of age, he tried to secure a government post for him but never succeeded. He served as mayor of Plymouth in 1796 and served as Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833; he was also Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. Sir William served as an officer in the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of Lieutenant Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars. Sir William was a talented amateur painter in oils and watercolors who exhibited at the Royal Society from 1774 to 1837; he exhibited still lifes and portraits but preferred landscapes. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1790. He was also a talented amateur naturalist and was elected to the Royal Linnaean Society in 1790; late in life, he published his findings on an alternative to yeast. According to <persName ref="#Lestrange">L'Estrange</persName>, Elford was a friend of <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">Mitford's father</persName>, and <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> met him for the first time in the spring of 1810 when he was a widower nearing the age of 64. They carried on a lively correspondence until his death. He died at Totnes, Devon on November 30, 1837.</note>

He served as a Captain in the South Devonshire militia from 1803, with his father, who was also an officer. On May 10, 1810, he married Charlotte Wynne. He also became a freeman for Plymouth in 1810. He served as Member of Parliament for Westbury from March 10 to November 29, a seat he secured under the patronage of Sir Manasseh Masseh Lopes. At this time, Westbury was a controversial "rotten borough" whose interest Lopes had purchased from Lord Abingdon; he resigned his seat in November 1810 to Lopes. Throughout his adulthood, his father Sir William tried unsuccessfully to secure him a position within the government. He died on March 11, 1823, at his home at Uplands, Tamerton Folliott, Devon. His death at the age of 46 left Sir William without an heir.</note>

Scholars have disagreed about whether this was the case, although <persName ref="#Roberts_Wm">William Roberts</persName> claimed to have heard it from <persName ref="#Taylor_JH">J.H.

It seems fairly unlikely, although not utterly impossible, that George Mitford, who died in December 11, 1842, aged eighty-eight, could have fathered a son born in April 1843, four months after his death. It is certain that J. H. Taylor could have had no memories of George. Another possible father for K.'s son is Benjamin Embrey, a man of approximately K's own age who worked at the Mitford's home as a manservant and gardener in the early 1840s. He appears with George, Mary Russell, and Kerenhappuch, in the 1841 census. Taylor later married Samuel Sweetman, another Mitford household manservant and gardener, in July 1852 and together they had two children:  Samuel Thomas Sweetman and Mary Russell Mitford Sweetman. Taylor was the residuary legatee in Mitford's 1855 will and later contested William Harness's rights to Mitford's letters in a 1870's lawsuit. At the 1861 census, she lived at Shute End, Wokingham, Berkshire. She died in April, 1880 at Henley, Oxfordshire.</p></note>

              <note resp="#lmw">Reportedly the illegitimate son of <persName ref="#Taylor_K">Kerenhappuch Taylor</persName>. Born about <date when="1843">1843</date> at Three Mile Cross, he was baptized at St. Giles, Reading, Berkshire on April 9, 1843. He consistently gives his birthplace as "Three Mile Cross" on census documents from the second half of the nineteenth century. His occupation is given as "clerk in holy orders." Since he disappears from English census records after 1861, reappearing in 1891, and gives his son Arthur Harry Edmund's birthplace as Isipingo, Natal, South Africa (then a British colony), it seems possible that he emigrated to South Africa between those dates, then returned to England.
