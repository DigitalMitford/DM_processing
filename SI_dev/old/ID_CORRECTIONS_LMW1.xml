He entered Oriel College, Oxford on June 3, 1795 and came to reside thereafter at Tamerton Folliot, Devon on an estate he called Upland. He served as a Captain in the South Devonshire militia from 1803, with his father, who was also an officer. On May 10, 1810, he married Charlotte Wynne. He also became a freeman for Plymouth in 1810. He served as Member of Parliament for Westbury from March 10 to November 29, a seat he secured under the patronage of Sir Manasseh Masseh Lopes. At this time, Westbury was a controversial "rotten borough" whose interest Lopes had purchased from Lord Abingdon; he resigned his seat in November 1810 to Lopes. Throughout his adulthood, his father Sir William tried unsuccessfully to secure him a position within the government. He died on March 11, 1823, at his home at Uplands, Tamerton Folliott, Devon. His death at the age of 46 left Sir William without an heir.</note>

               <note type="bio" resp="#lmw">British author and journalist, friend and associate of literary-political radicals such as William Godwin. Author of the plays The Road to Ruin (1792) and Deaf and Dumb (1801), his work is important in the development of early nineteenth-century melodrama. He was also the author of Anna St. Ives (1792), considered the first "Jacobin" political novel of the 1790s. Arrested along with Hardy and Horne Tooke as part of the "Treason Trials" of 1794, he was later released without being brought to trial. William Hazlitt later edited his memoirs (1816, 1852).</note>
