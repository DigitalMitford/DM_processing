He was baptised in Kingsbridge on <date when="1749-10-31">October 31, 1749</date>. He married <persName ref="#Elford_MrsM">Mary Davies</persName> of Plympton on <date when="1776-01-20">January 20, 1776</date> and they had one son, <persName ref="#Elford_J_WEson">Jonathan</persName>, and two daughters, <persName ref="#Elford_Grace">Grace Chard</persName> and <persName ref="#Elford_Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. After the death of his first wife, he married <persName ref="#Elford_MrsE">Elizabeth Hall Walrond</persName>, widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Maine Swete Walrond of the Coldstream Guards. <persName ref="#Elford_MrsE">Elizabeth Hall</persName> was the daughter and co-heir of Humphry Hall of Manadon, Devon, and had two children by her previous marriage, although only her son lived to adulthood. <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William</persName>'s only son <persName ref="#Elford_J_WEson">Jonathan</persName> died in <date when="1823">1823</date>, leaving him without an heir. He worked as a banker at Plymouth Bank (Elford, Tingcombe and Purchase) in Plymouth, Devon, from its founding in 1782. He was elected a member of Parliament for Plymouth as a supporter of the government and Tory William Pitt, and served from 1796 to 1806. After his election defeat in Plymouth in 1806, he was elected member of Parliament for Rye and served from July 1807 until his resignation in July 1808. For his service in Parliament as a supporter of Pitt, he was made a baronet in 1800; after his son <persName ref="#Elford_J_WEson">Jonathan</persName> came of age, he tried to secure a government post for him but he never succeeded. He served as mayor of Plymouth in 1796 and served as Recorder for Plymouth from 1797 to 1833; he was also Recorder for Totnes from 1832 to 1834. <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William</persName> served as an officer in the South Devon militia from 1788, eventually attaining the rank of Lieutenant Colonel; the unit saw active service in Ireland during the Peninsular Wars. <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William</persName> was a talented amateur painter in oils and watercolors who exhibited at the Royal Society from 1774 to 1837; he exhibited still lifes and portraits but preferred landscapes. He was elected to the Royal Society Academy in 1790.

                        <p>William Harness was born on March 14, 1790 in Wickham, Berkshire to John Harness, M.D. and Sarah Dredge; he was baptized at Whitchurch, Hampshire on April 13, 1790. He received his B.A. in 1812 and his M.A. in 1816 from Christ's College, Cambridge. He served as curate at Kelmeston, Hampshire (1812) and Dorking (1814-1816). He was preacher at Trinity Chapel, Conduit Stree, London and minister and lecturer at St. Anne's in Soho. He was Boyle lecturer in London (1822) and was curate at Hampstead from 1828 to 1844. In 1825, he published an eight-volume edition of Shakespeare, including a biography; his friends would later endow a prize in his name at Cambridge for the study of Shakespearean literature. He also authored numerous essays and reviews, some for the Quarterly Review. From 1844 to 1847 he was minister of Brompton Chapel in London. He undertook to raise the funds to build the church of All Saints, Knightsbridge, in the parish of St. Margaret's Westminster, which opened in 1849, and became perpetual curate of that congregation. At the 1851 and 1861 censuses, he lived at 3 Hyde Park Terrace, Westminster St. Margaret, Middlesex, with his sister Mary Harness and his first cousin Jemima Harness, daughter of his uncle William. He died on November 11, 1869 while on a visit to one of his former curates in Battle, Sussex. At the time of his death he living at the same address at 3 Hyde Park Terrace; he is buried in Bath.

                        <p>A lifelong friend of <persName ref="#MRM">Mary Russell Mitford</persName> who knew her from their childhood in the 1790s, Harness launched the first major effort to collect and edit Mitford's letters into a series of volumes, which was completed by his assistant, <persName ref="#Lestrange">Alfred Guy Kingan L'Estrange</persName> a year after Harness's death, and published as <title ref="#Lestrange_Letters">The Life of Mary Russell Mitford, Related in a Selection from her Letters to her Friends</title>. This collection was originally intended to be six volumes, but was cut back to three by the publishers, to Harness's distress. According to the DNB, "After the death of Miss Mitford, he produced, amid considerable opposition from interested parties, "The life of Mary Russell Mitford," which he just lived to see completed."</p>
                        <p>Harness and <persName ref="#Byron">Byron</persName> were also friends from their schooling at Harrow, as Byron reportedly sympathized with Harness's experience of a disabled foot, crushed in an accident in early childhood. Byron considered dedicating <bibl>the first two cantos of <title>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</title>
                        </bibl> to Harness, but refrained so as not to taint Harness's reputation as he was taking orders as an Anglican curate. Harness admired and encouraged Mitford's playwrighting in particular, and she commented that he was one of the few of her friends who thought she should prioritize the drama over prose. When <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">William Macready</persName> was attacked in <bibl corresp="#Stage">an anonymous Blackwood's Magazine piece in 1825</bibl> for his demands and rudeness to Mitford over revisions to <title ref="#Rienzi">Rienzi</title>, Macready assumed that Harness was the author of the anonymous piece, though in <date when="1839">1839</date> after many years of distance, Harness assured Macready in person that he was not the writer, though he may have shared word of the poor treatment his friend had endured.</p> [Sources: <bibl>

Her first husband was Robert Sinclair, 7th Baronet Sinclair; they married in 1789 and had one child, John Gordon Sinclair. Her second husband was the Reading Whig politician <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Charles Fyshe Palmer</persName>. They married in 1805 at Kimbolton Castle in Kimbolton, Herefordshire. They lived at Luckley House, Wokingham, Berkshire and at East Court, Finchampstead, Berkshire. Through her siblings, Lady Madelina was connected to several of the most influential aristocratic families in the country. Her sister Charlotte Gordon became Duchess of Richmond through her marriage to Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond, 4th Duke of Lennox and 4th Duke of Aubigny. Her sister Susan Gordon became Duchess of Manchester through her marriage to William Montagu, Duke of Manchester. Her sister Louise Gordon became Marchioness Cornwallis through marriage to Charles Cornwallis, Marquess of Cornwallis. Her sister Georgiana Gordon became Duchess of Bedford through marriage to John Russell, Duke of Bedford. Her brothers were George Duncan Gordon, who became 5th Duke of Gordon, and Lord Alexander Gordon. Charles Fyshe Palmer's marriage to Lady Madelina thus gained him access to aristocratic houses, including the <orgName>Holland House</orgName>. Lady Madelina died on March 31, 1847 at Chapel Street, Grosvenor Place, London. Her name is variously spelled "Madelina" and "Madalina," although "Madelina" appears to be the more common and standard spellling of the name, as an anglicization of the French Madeline.

He married Lady Madelina Gordon Sinclair in 1805 at Kimbolton Castle in Kimbolton, Herefordshire. They lived at Luckley House, Wokingham, Berkshire and at East Court, Finchampstead, Berkshire. Through her siblings, Lady Madelina was connected to several of the most influential aristocratic families in the country.

Lady Madelina died on March 31, 1847 at Chapel Street, Grosvenor Place, London.</p>
                     <p>A Whig politician, Palmer began running for Parliament elections as the member for <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> <date notBefore="1816">after 1816</date>, and appears to have served off and on in that role until <date notAfter="1841">1841</date>. He led the Berkshire meetings to protest British government's handling of <rs type="event" ref="#Peterloo">the Peterloo Massacre</rs> in <date when="1819">1819</date>. On March 16, 1820, Palmer ran for a seat in Parliament against two other candidates. The votes ran: <persName ref="#Monck_JB">John Berkeley Monck</persName> (418 votes), <persName ref="#Palmer_CF">Charles Fyshe Palmer</persName>(399 votes), and <persName ref="#Weyland_John">John Weyland</persName>(395 votes.) Mitford's letters around this time indicate she much preferred his opponent <persName ref="#Monck_JB">J. B. Monck</persName>, and she had earlier satirized Palmer in <date when="1818">1818</date> as <quote defective="false">"vastly like a mop-stick, or, rather, a tall hop-pole, or an extremely long fishing-rod, or anything that is all length and no substance."</quote></p>
                     <p>Mitford also mentions Palmer in connection with a legal issue surrounding <orgName ref="#Billiard_Club">the Billiard Club</orgName>, in <rs type="letter"> her letter to <persName ref="#Talfourd_Thos">Talfourd</persName> of <date when="1822-08-31">31 August 1822</date></rs>.

Thomas Noon Talfourd was born on <date when="1795-05-26">May 26, 1795</date> at <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading, Berkshire</placeName> and baptised on <date when="1795-07-12">July 12, 1795</date> at the Broad Street Chapel in Reading, the eldest child of Rev. Edward Talfourd and Anne Isabella Noon. His father was a brewer and later established a lunatic asylum for female patients at Normand House, Fulham, which he ran until his death, and the supervision of which was later conducted by his wife and his daughter Anne. Thomas Noon Talfourd died at <placeName>Stafford, Staffordshire, England</placeName> while serving in the Court of Stafford; he was buried in Norwood cemetery.</p>
                     <p>Thomas Noon Talfourd married <persName ref="#Talfourd_Mrs">Rachel Rutt</persName> on <date when="1822-08-31">August 31, 1822</date> at St. John, Hackney, Middlesex. Rachel was the daughter of radical politician and writer <persName ref="#Rutt_John">John Towill Rutt</persName>. Thomas and Rachel had five children:  Francis, Mary, Katharine, Thomas Noon [II], and William Wordsworth. In 1832, the family lived at 26 Henrietta Street, St Andrew, Holborn and St George the Martyr, Bloomsbury, England. In 1837, they lived at 56 Russell Square, St. George, Bloomsbury. Talfourd's chambers were at 2 Elm Court, Temple, London.</p>
                     <p>Talfourd was educated at the newly-established Mill Hill school, a dissenting academy in Reading, from 1808 to 1810. He attended Dr. <persName ref="#Valpy_Richard">Richard Valpy</persName>'s <orgName ref="#Reading_School">Reading School</orgName> from 1810 to 1812. He completed a legal apprenticeship with Joseph Christy, special pleader, in 1817, and was called to the bar in London in 1821. He ultimately earned a D.C.L. (Doctor of Civil Laws) from Oxford on June 20, 1844. While establishing his practice as a barrister and special pleader, he worked as legal correspondent for The Times, reporting on the Oxford Circuit, and also continued his literary interests. After 1833, he had been appointed Serjeant at Law, as well as a King's and Queen's Counsel. He was elected and served as Member of Parliament for Reading from 1835 to 1841 and from 1847 to 1849; he served with Charles Fyshe Palmer, Charles Russell, and Francis Piggott. Highlights of his political and legal career included introducing the first copyright bill into Parliament in 1837 (for which action Charles Dickens dedicated Pickwick Papers to him) and defending Edward Moxon's publication of Percy Shelley's Queen Mab in 1841. He was appointed Queen's Serjeant in 1846 and Judge of Common Pleas in 1849, at which post he served until his death in 1854. He was knighted in 1850.</p>
                     <p>Talfourd’s literary works include his plays <bibl><title ref="#Ion_TNTplay">Ion</title> (1835)</bibl>, <bibl><title>The Athenian Captive</title> (<date>1837</date>)</bibl> and <bibl><title>Glencoe, or the Fate of the MacDonalds</title>(<date>1839</date>)</bibl>.</p>
