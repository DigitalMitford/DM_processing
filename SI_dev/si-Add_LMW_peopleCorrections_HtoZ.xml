She was guillotined in 1793 for treason against France and was buried in an unmarked grave; her body and that of her husband were exhumed during the Bourbon Restoration and reburied at the Basilica of St. Denis.</note>

                  <note resp="#lmw">Military commander and political leader. During the French Revolution and Revolutionary Wars, Napoleon rose to prominence as a military leader. He engineered a coup in 1799 that brought him to power as First Consul of France and then as Napoleon I, Emperor of the French (from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815). As Emperor, he led France against a series of European military coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars, building an empire that extended over most of continental Europe until its collapse in 1815. In spring 1814, the Allies captured Paris and forced Napoleon to abdicate, exiling him to the island of Elba and restoring the Bourbons to power. Less than a year later, Napoleon escaped from Elba and retook control of France, only to suffer defeat by the Allies at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. The British then exiled him to the island Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, where he remained until his death in 1821. He is celebrated as one of Europe's greatest military commanders and as the disseminator of the system of laws known as the Napoleonic Code.</note>

Best known for lyric poems such as "Ozymandias," the utopian mental drama Prometheus Unbound, and his professions of atheism and other deeply controversial ideologies, Shelley was also one of the "Cockney poets" associated with his sometime editor Leigh Hunt. He was also a friend of Byron and the husband of Mary Shelley. His work was little read or respected during his lifetime. </note>

He was exiled to Great Britain in the late 1720s, where he met and influenced many British notables.</note>

                     Wakefield, which seems likely, cross-checking with the ODNB. Wakefield's mother
                     was the Quaker writer Priscilla Bell Wakefield, though Wakefield himself
                     converted to the Church of England. He published <title>An Essay on Political
                        Economy</title> in 1799, and qualified for the law in 1807. His first wife,
                        <persName>Isabella Mackie</persName>, swindled him of much of his income and
                     nearly bankrupted him, before she fatally poisoned herself in August 1813.
                     Later that year, 11 November 1813, Wakefield married <persName>Elizabeth
                        Kilgour</persName>. He was eventually very successful and much consulted on
                     legal cases.</note>

He and William Roberts founded the Christian evangelical periodial the British Review and London Critical Journal, a quarterly that appeared between 1811 and 1825. He authored several publications on population and the English poor laws, including A Short Enquiry into the Policy, Humanity, and Effect of the Poor Laws (1807); Observations on Mr. Whitbread's Poor Bill and on the Population of England (1807); The Principle of the English Poor Laws, illustrated from the Evidence given by Scottish Proprietors (before the Corn Committee,) on the Connexion observed in Scotland between the Price of Grain and the Wages of Labour (1815); and The Principles of Population and Production as they are affected by the Progress of Society (1816). He believed that hardship was an incentive to industry and he did not support further education of the poor.</p>
                     <p>On <date when="1820-03-16">March 16, 1820</date>, Weyland was the "Blue" or Tory candidate, supported by the municipal corporation, in the Reading election.

See <ptr target="http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/constituencies/reading"/>. Weyland later won a seat as Member of Parliament for Hindon, Wiltshire, and served from 1830 to 1832.</p>

From 1784 until his death he held the post of curate of Selborne, Hampshire. White's most famous and widely-cited book, <bibl>The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne</bibl> was admired by <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford </persName> for its careful observations of nature.

An important amateur natural historian, botanist, and ornithologist, he emphasized the interrelatedness of plants and animals within an environment in ways that foreshadow modern ecology. Because of his botanical work, his name has been accorded a standard abbreviation for citation purposes in the <bibl>International Code of Botanic Nomenclature</bibl>.

                        Wordsworth</persName>; her diary entries, poems, and sketches were not
                     published until after her death, but demonstrably influenced her brother's more
                     famous work. Lived with her brother at Racedown Lodge, Dorset; Alfoxden House, Somerset; Goslar, Lower Saxony; and Dove Cottage, Grasmere, Westmorland; and Rydal Mount, Grasmere, Westmorland. She fell seriously ill in 1829 and remained an invalid until her death in 1855. She wrote <title>Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland</title> in 1803, but could not find a publisher and it was not published until 1874. Her <title>Grasmere Journal</title> was edited by William Knight and published in 1897.</note>
