The first theater on this site was opened in 1732 by John Rich, renovated by architect Henry Holland in 1792, and destroyed by fire on 20 Sept. 1808. The second theater, designed by Robert Smirke, opened on 18 Sept. 1809 and was managed by <persName ref="#Kemble_JP">John Phillip Kemble</persName>. Because of rent increases by the Duke of Bedford, the landowner, J.P. Kemble increased ticket prices. This led to the "old price (or O.P.) riots" and the eventual lowering of ticket prices, although the proprietors proved they would lose money at those prices. The second theater was destroyed by fire on 5 March 1856. The third theater, designed by Edward Middleton Barry, opened in 1858 and remains at the center of today's theater complex. The theater became the Royal Opera House in 1892 and the building was renovated and expanded in the 1980s and 1990s.

                  <note>Historically, a four thousand acre tract of heathland outside London near Hounslow in the county of Middlesex, crossed by major routes between London and the west and southwest of England. In <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName>'s time, the heath was crossed by the Great West Road and the Bath Road and, as it had been in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, was still known as a dangerous spot for unwary travellers who might find themselves robbed by highwaymen or footpads. From at least the English Civil Wars until World War II, the heath has been used as a military staging area and training ground. Today, all that remains of the heath is two hundred acres preserved as parkland.</note>
