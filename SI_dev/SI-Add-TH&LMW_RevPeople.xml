                          <note>Henry Vane (called "Harry" and "Henry Vane the Younger" to distinquish him from his father), was baptized on March 26, 1613 and died on June 14, 1662. A supporter of religious freedom, Vane served as the 6th Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and supported the creation of Roger Williams' Rhode Island Colony and Harvard College. He became a Parliamentarian political leader and worked closely with Oliver Cromwell, serving on the Council of State during the Interregnum, although he refused to play any part in the executation of King Charles I and he resigned when Cromwell dissolved Parliament in 1653. He briefly returned to power between 1659 and 1660 during the Commonwealth period. He was arrested under orders from Charles II and charged with treason by Parliament. He was ultimately exempted from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act, and was thus denied amnesty granted to most people for their roles in the Civil War and Interregnum. After a lengthy trial, he was executed at Tower Hill, London.</note>

                     Wakefield, which seems likely, cross-checking with the ODNB. Wakefield's mother
                     was the Quaker writer Priscella Bell Wakefield, though Wakefield himself
                     converted to the Church of England. He published <title>An Essay of Political
                        Economy</title> in 1799, and qualified for the law in 1807. His first wife,
                        <persName>Isabella Mackie</persName>, swindled him of much of his income and
                     nearly bankrupted him, before she fatally poisoned herself in August 1813.
                     Later that year, 11 November 1813, Wakefield married <persName>Elizabeth
                        Kilgour</persName>. He was eventually very successful and much consulted on
                     legal cases. </note>
