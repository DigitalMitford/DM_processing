            <p>>A thousand thanks to my good &amp; kind &amp; Dear Correspondent for his two charming letters! Which astonished &amp; delighted me almost as much as the sight of my <!--??--> falling from the cloud Like a stick (as you &amp; Mr. Thomas Paine(what a conjunction!!!) wittily say) <!--??-->  have done. By the way this last mentioned worthy is <emph rend="underline">mine</emph>. What made you imagine that he was? I know nothing about him--never read a line of his writings in my life--<add place="above">not</add> those of any of his fellow <!--??--> Never even saw the outside of them--Never set eyes on the Rights of Man--Never looked at the Rights of Woman--Never opened the Political Justice--Know nothing about the <!--??--> jacobinical rogues &amp; vagueness--Read no such books--Keep no such company--Have a vast fancy set the Attorney General to work upon you for libeling me with such a supposition--Desire you'll beg pardon for "dishonouring thus my <emph rend="underline">loyal</emph> name" &amp; promise to behave better in future.--Supposing you to have made this promise I will now confess that though I have actually never read any one of the works I have metnioned it has not proceeded from want of inclination--for the two last especially. I like some of Godwin's writings extremely particularly his Life of Chaucer--&amp; Caleb Williams shocking as the subject is is certainly a masterpiece--full of vigour power &amp; passion--with magical lights amid supernatural darkness like Rembrand'ts paintings &amp; Lord Byron's poetry. For th sake of these works as well as of the "Enquirer" I have long wished to read the POlitical Justice &amp; the high renown of Mary Wollstonecraft as well as the interest of the subject, has, in addition to an accusation that has been brought against the Madame de Stael of most atrocious plagiarism from this work given me a strong desire to see the Rights of Woman. As to the Rights of Man I should like to look at it as a curious book--but the Author was in every point of view so detestable that I will not let you call him my friend even in joke--not even though I <!--??--> in meeting with his work which I do verily believe is with the two others I have been talking about vanished from the face of the earth. Pray can you lend them to me? If you cannot I shall give up the point in despair &amp; conclude that they were actually burnt at Charing-Cross, for I have really asked every one of my acquaintance without success.  Dr. Valpy who has an immense Library containing all the books that fine libraries do contain he has them not--And Mrs. Perry whose collection is still more splendid containing not only all <add place="above">that</add> fine libraries have but all that they have not--he being you must know a Bibliomaniac of the first class--he has them not. If you cannot assist me I must certainly go with Astolfo &amp; look for them in the Moon.---How many thousand miles out of my course has this digression carried me! I was about my dear Sir WIlliam to thank you not only for your dear letters but for the dear wished piece of goodness that one of them contains. You have certainly not read Swift <pb n="2"/>for nothing. I never saw any imitation of his almost inimitale irony so thoroughly imbued with his admirable spirit--It is just in manner &amp; matter what he would have said on the same subject. Who that has read that could even waltze again! I will certainly return you this exquisite pen d'esprit as soon as Papa goes to Town or I can catch a Member here--At present these birds of passage--of whom like some other birds <emph rend="underline">not</emph> of passage that <emph rend="underline">pen feathers</emph> are the most valuable pars--are all migrated to London.</p>
            <p>I am quite of your opinion with regard to this <!--??--> new Legion of Honour--but I am very gald that Ministers have done this foolish thing not from any ill will that I bear them--for Ministers are pretty much alike whether Whigs or Tories, stupid wiseacres--but because it will afford a good subje<!--torn: ct for --> the opposition Speakers &amp; we shall stand a chance of some good <!--torn--> from Whitbread &amp; Tierney. This is all the interest I feel in the affairs of the Nation. What do you think of the Court Martial of Sir John Murray? Don't you think that he &amp; General Donkin (oh he is no General for me take my word for it--I won't have him even though he when he comes to see me should take the incredible fancy of wanting to have me!) Don't you think that these two gallant officers seem to have said to each other that on that unlucky 12th of June "The French are coming--let us run away." I am sure their actions &amp; sad so--&amp; I am so delighted with that delightful half mutinous signal of Admiral Hallowell's that signal which <!--??--> who was more than half mutinous himself on all occasions, would infallibly have made that I shall be quite disappointed in he should lose his cause--which he <add place="above">most likely</add> will do for Papa's friends <pb n="3"/> in Winchester write that Sir <!--J. M.??--> will certainly be acquitted. Do you know any thing of Sir John? I saw him several times about <!--8??--> years ago in <!--??--> while staying at his Cousin &amp; <!--??--> Aynsleys; &amp; I remember, in spite of his fine person &amp; easy manners, remarking at the time, that I never saw a man with such absolute nothingness of character, never knew any one whom a Lady in want of such a machine would so unhesitatingly employ in the absence of a real or a chair back or any other convenient piece of wood to hold silk on his fingers.--Thank you stars that you are going to pay postage for this letter &amp; that it cannot be double--My dear dear Papa is confined with a sprained knee which is a sad thing in this glorious weather. did you ever know such in February? I had a nosegay of violets &amp; heartsease sent me from a common border in Mrs. Newell's garden.--God bless you my dear Friend--Kind regards from Papa &amp; Mama--<closer>Ever &amp; ever most sincerely affectionately your's.<lb/> <persName ref="#MRM">M.R.M.</persName></closer></p>
