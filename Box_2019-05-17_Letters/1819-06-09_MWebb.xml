              <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

            <p>Your kind &amp; charming letter, my own kind &amp; charming friend, gave me two pleasures<add place='above'><metamark rend="caret" place="below">today</metamark></add> that of hearing from you &amp; that of not hearing from <persName ref="#Nooth_C">Miss Nooth</persName>). <q>"Humph"</q> quoth I when <persName ref="#Hill_Lucy">Lucy</persName> gave it me <q>"Here had I just got quit of my blue-stocking, just sent her a huge packet to <placeName ref="#Paris">Paris</placeName>--all the wit &amp; learning I have to spare; &amp; now have another letter to answer!

Meanwhile I read one from somebody else (you always contrive to come in a good company <persName ref="#Webb_Mary_younger">Mary</persName>) &amp; then condescended to take it up again. Imagine my surprise &amp; my pleasure to find dear <persName ref="#Webb_Mary_younger">Mary Webb</persName>) in the place of <persName ref="#Nooth_C">Charlotte Nooth</persName> so you see you were right as to the similarity of the handwriting for I had quite forgotten what you said on the subject &amp; <persName ref="#Nooth_C">Miss N.</persName> was not at all in my head--You write like her in every way--only that you have a much greater knack of making people believe you love them--I suppose my dear because it happens to be true--&amp; that it is which gives your letters that preference over hers which one gives to a living flower over a dead one--the principle of life.--You must not say that I <emph rend="underline">would</emph> not come to <pb n="2"/><placeName ref="#Watlington">Watlington</placeName>--I was quite ready--packed--dressed--nothing wanting but the promised horse--ours never could have dragged me--<persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">Papa</persName>says he walked half the way--&amp; think of my weight. I was very much disappointed--for I wanted to see you all--particularly you &amp; dear <persName ref="#Webb_Eliza">Eliza</persName>--no you must not say--you must not think I would not come--for really &amp; truly I meant it (this it is to have a bad reputation--if I had not broken some 22 engagements this Spring to <placeName ref="#Twickenham">Twickenham</placeName> <placeName ref="#Richmond">Richmond</placeName>, <placeName ref="#London_city">London</placeName> &amp; <placeName ref="#Paris">Paris</placeName> I need not take so much pains to be <emph rend="underline">dis</emph>-believed--take warning by my fate &amp; keep all promises <persName ref="#Webb_Mary_younger">Mary</persName> mine--but breaking engagements is a family fault--<persName ref="#Russell_M">Mama</persName> never makes one without meaning to break it--&amp; my honoured <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">Father</persName> has within one week promised to spend <date when="1819-08">August</date> at <placeName ref="#Paris">Paris</placeName> &amp; <date when="1819-08">August</date> at <placeName ref="#Bickham_village">Bickham</placeName>--How he'll settle it I don't know.

I hope you read this delightful book in French--it is so untranslateable--the class of Memoires is the only one in which the French literature is richer than ours--there are perhaps a hundred publications of that sort (Most of them less witty &amp; less licentious than the <title ref="#Mems_de_Grammont">Memoires de Grammont</title>) in the language. The very best are the <title ref="#Mems_de_Sully">Memoires de Sully</title>--the pleasantest perhaps those of<persName ref="#deRouvroy">M. Le Duke de St. Simon</persName>--a wit who hated every body.

(What a nice pen I have made!!) No! I never saw <placeName ref="#Strawberry_Hill">Strawberry Hill</placeName> though I have seen the famous <placeName ref="#Strawberry_Hill">Strawberry Hill</placeName> books--all I believe--especially the edition of <title ref="#Mems_de_Grammont">Les Memoires de Grammont</title> for which the pictures were collected. I never saw <placeName ref="#Strawberry_Hill">Strawberry Hill</placeName>--but I know exactly what it is--a gingerbread castle--Modern Gothic--all gilding &amp; painted glass--smelling of courts all over--a very abomination of trumpery--I know all this--&amp; yet I had rather see <placeName ref="#Strawberry_Hill">Strawberry Hill</placeName> than any place I know of. I should like to see <persName ref="#Hamilton_An">Count Anthony</persName>'s heroes &amp; heroines--I should like to see the Kings &amp; beauties of the white rose--my dear <persName ref="#EdwardIV">Edward the Fourth</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#RichardIII">Richard the Third</persName>--I should like to see <persName ref="#Sevigne_Mad">Madame de Sevigné</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#deGrignan_Fr">Madame de Grignan</persName> I should like even to see the old China--but chiefly I should like to see the abode of <persName ref="#Walpole_Hor">Horace Walpole</persName>--the man of the last Century who pleases the best. Did you never read any of his letters? His unrivalled letters? I shall always consider it as one of the misfortunes of my life to have been born too late to be his Correspondent--Unless you have seen some of his letters there is no giving you any idea of them, the perfection of lightness, elegance, sarcasm &amp; humour as picturesque as old Tapestry--as vivid as <pb n="5"/>stained glass--as graceful as a Grecian scroll. There is no giving you any notion of <persName ref="#Walpole_Hor">Horace Walpole</persName>--except perhaps by negatives. He is never wise--never good--very seldom right--&amp; never dull. He is just become the fashion--to my great annoyance--I have loved him--all my days &amp; am quite provoked that <title ref="#EdinburghRev_per">Edinburgh</title> &amp; <title ref="#QuarterlyRev_per">Quarterly</title> Reviews should step in &amp; make him common.--The only consolation that I have in being born some fifty or sixty years too late to rival his old blind Correspondent <persName ref="#duDeffand">Madame du Deffand</persName>--is that I have much such another myself--not quite so good--but almost--incredibly good for a living man--very like him at all points--pleasant, humourous, graceful &amp; as courtly as <persName ref="#Walpole_Hor">Horace</persName> himself--only rather to apt to be right. This Correspondent you know is <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William Elford</persName>--He has been here while you were away &amp; gave me a long account of the Exhibition--the picture of the year Madam, is he says <title ref="#PostOffice_EVR">the Post Office,</title>the judges prefer it to <persName ref="#Wilkie_D">Wilkie</persName>'s<note resp="#lmw">Refers to <title ref="#PennyWedding">Penny Wedding</title></note>--&amp; being by a new man, the wonder &amp; pleasure go hand in hand.--Then I have a long account of pictures from <persName ref="#Hofland_B">Mrs. Hofland</persName> who says the hanging Committee ought to be hanged--a short one from <persName ref="#Haydon">Haydon</persName>. (today) who except this <title ref="#PostOffice_EVR">Post Office,</title> <title ref="#PennyWedding">Wilkie's Picture</title>--&amp; <title ref="#MarstonM"><persName ref="#Cooper_Ab">Cooper</persName>'s Battle of Marston</title> &amp; <title ref="#JacobsDream">Alstons' Jacob<unclear reason="torn"><supplied resp="#lmw">'s</supplied></unclear>Dream</title>--says of all the <del rend="squiggles" unit="1" type="word">Exhibitors</del> <orgName ref="#Royal_Academy">Academy</orgName> <q>"Heaven help them!</q> Instead of having over their door in Greek <q>Let no one unskilled in Art enter here</q>, They should put <q>"lasciete ogni Speranza voi ch' entrate"</q><note resp="#lmw"><title ref="#Inferno_Dante">Dante's Inferno</title>, Canto 3--></note>--which lovely line you must know <persName ref="#Haydon">Mr. Haydon</persName> has taken from from the Inscription over the Gate of Hell in <title ref="#Inferno_Dante">Dante's Inferno</title>, &amp; means literally all ye who enter leave all hope behind. So you find he is growing saucy again--&amp; well enough to paint thank Heaven.--When you come &amp; see me I write tell you all the little things which prevented my sending you to see his picture--the greatest was my intention to come to <placeName ref="#London_city">Town</placeName> &amp; take you myself--I do hope however before the summer is over to show you to him here which will be better every way.--I want most dismally to see you my own dear <persName ref="#Webb_Mary_younger">Mary</persName>--when can you come? <persName ref="#Mitford_Geo">Papa</persName> &amp; <persName ref="#Russell_M">Mama</persName> are going into <placeName ref="#Hampshire_county">Hampshire</placeName> on <date when="1819-06-13">Sunday</date> or <date when="1819-06-14">Monday</date> for the week--Now the now in your unbounded hospitality. <pb n="6"/> that full or empty you will will be asking me to come to you. But I can't our people are all crazed with love--<persName ref="#Russell_M">Mama</persName> would not go till I had promised her not to leave the house--so you must come &amp; see me that is certain. Cannot you come on <date when="1819-06-15">Tuesday</date> you &amp; our dear <persName ref="#Webb_Eliza">Eliza</persName>--or dear <persName ref="#Webb_Mary_elder">Aunt Mary</persName> or dear <persName ref="#Wheeler_Kate">Kate Wheeler</persName>--or even you alone? Pray do if possible &amp; let me know--or any other day that will suit you better--only let me know for fear of my prime minister <persName ref="#Hill_Lucy">Lucy</persName> hopping out. Do come &amp; spend a long day with me &amp; tell me all about <orgName ref="#James_family">the James's</orgName> &amp; a thousand things that I wish to hear. I will be very charming &amp; amusing in my turn I promise you.--You shall then <choice><sic>chuse</sic><reg>choose</reg></choice> some books. <persName ref="#Burns_Rob">Burns</persName> though you may have seen it here was not mine--I have only a trumpery small edition--<title ref="#Burns_Wks_Currie">Dr. Currie's Life</title> I had from <placeName ref="#Coley_Berks">Coley</placeName>--If <persName ref="#Valpy_Richard">Dr. Valpy</persName> has it I will borrow it for you--No book can be more charming.--I am delighted to hear so favorable an account of your dear <persName ref="#Webb_James">Father</persName>--I hope he has been very prudent this week &amp; not suffered from his hospitality--The puppies arrived very late &amp; are the greatest beauties ever seen--I have scarcely room for my kindest love to All &amp; God bless you.</p>

He became governer of Limerick and would contiuned to be inside of the goverment for the rest of his life. Mémoires du comte de Gramont is his most famous piece of writing. He also created tales that  circulated privately during Hamilton's lifetime. The first three appeared in Paris in 1730 which was ten years after he died.

The work was said to have been written at Grammont's dictation, but Hamilton's share is obvious. Written between 1704 and 1710, the work was first published anonymously in 1713 (apparently without Hamilton's knowledge) under the rubric of Cologne, but it was really printed in the Netherlands. An English translation by Abel Boyer appeared in 1714 and then over 30 further editions then appeared (Wikipedia).</note>

             Saint-Simon's Mémoires strike a most realistic note. On the one hand, he is petty, unjust to private enemies and is known as a gossip. Yet he shows a great skill for narrative and for character-drawing; he has been compared to Tacitus, and to historians such as Livy. He is at the same time not a writer who can be "sampled" easily,[1] inasmuch as his most characteristic passages sometimes occur in the midst of long stretches of quite uninteresting diatribe. His vocabulary was extreme and inventive; he is deemed to have first used the word "intellectual" as a noun, and "patriot" and "publicity" are also accredited as being introduced by him in their current usage.

             The first six books, collected in 1668, were in the main adapted from the classical fabulists Aesop, Babrius and Phaedrus. In these, La Fontaine adhered to the path of his predecessors with some closeness; but in the later collections he allowed himself far more liberty and in the later books there is a wider range of sources (Wikipedia).

        These are letters from writing with her daughter for nearly thirty years. The first edition, containing twenty-eight letters or portions of letters, was published in 1725, followed by two others the next year. Pauline de Simiane, Mme de Sévigné's granddaughter, decided to officially publish her grandmother's correspondence. Working with the editor Denis-Marius Perrin of Aix-en-Provence, she published 614 letters in 1734-1737, then 772 letters in 1754. The letters were selected according to Mme de Simiane's instructions: she rejected those that dealt too closely with family matters, or those that seemed poorly written.

The greatest commentator on the picture was William Wordsworth, some of whose lines in his poem 'Composed upon an Evening of Extraordinary Splendour and Beauty' of 1817 were inspired by Allston’s picture (1). --></note>

A penny wedding was one where the guests were expected to bring their own food and drinks to the church or hall to celebrate after the ceremony. It is a custom that survived in the West Highlands until recently.--></note>

This kind of background information would usually introduce a work of far less quality that this landscape, with its fresh and subtle observation of the effect of a rainy Devon day. The light and effect of moist air is rendered with a precise and professional-looking technique. The motif cannot be confidently identified but may be near Sheepstor" (1). --></note>
