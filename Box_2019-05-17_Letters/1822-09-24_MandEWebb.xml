                        So when Mitford writes over two sheets of paper on the front and back of each, we've photographed four surfaces. When she writes on one sheet front and back, we've photographed two surfaces. Work closely with the photos of your letter to determine the number of sheets and separate surfaces, and describe how they are folded: in thirds?

           <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>
