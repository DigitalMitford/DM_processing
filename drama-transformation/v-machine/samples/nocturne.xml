                <note type="critical" anchored="true">There are three TS versions of this poem
                    entitled 'Nocturne, Saint Eloi, 1918'. It was nocturne_poemslished as 'Nocturne,
                    Saint Eloi, 1929' in The Irish Statesman, II:4 (28 September 1929) 69, under the
                    pseudonym L. Saint Senan (See 'Saint Senan's Well'). 'Nocturne' was written in
                    late 1928 or early 1929. To the editor's knowledge, it has not been
                    reprinted.</note>

                <note type="biographical" anchored="true">During World War I, MacGreevy served for
                    twenty-two months as a second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery, spending
                    most of that time in the front line of the Somme (after the war he was promoted
                    to the rank of lieutenant). In France he was wounded twice, the second time
                    (September 1918) more seriously at Commines, where he received a shoulder wound. </note>

                        <p>Eloi may also be a reference to the words of Christ on the cross: 'Eloi,
