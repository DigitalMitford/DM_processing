To such of my readers as may have witnessed Mr. Young’s performance of its hero, my feeble eulogium would, indeed, be superfluous, especially as, by the publication of the piece, I have enabled them to appreciate the delicate touches which belong exclusively to the performer. Still, I cannot

refrain from adding to my cordial thanks, one tribute, which none but the Authoress can pay; by declaring, with unfeigned sincerity, that the image present to my fancy, when writing that long and arduous part, has been perfectly and vividly embodied by the great actor to whom it has been so fortunately entrusted. To Mr. Cooper, I owe a double debt: as an actor, for his pure and affecting performance of Angelo; and, as a manager, for his ability in arranging the complicated business of the scene; and for the kindness and courtesy with which he lightened the labour of the preparations, to all who had a share in them. To Mrs. Faucit, I would in particular express my acknowledgments, for the discrimination and energy which she bestowed on a character important in the piece, but not calculated to reward the actress; whilst, to Miss Phillips, I owe an obligation of a different sort, for the pathos, the intelligence, and the modest sweetness, which, on their first development, have so enchanted the theatrical world. It is to me one of the most gratifying circumstances attendant on the production of Rienzi, that it has been

the medium of introducing to the acted drama, a young lady so fitted to adorn it, by every womanly grace. In short, to all the Performers, not only for the ability with which they filled their parts, but for the interest that they took in the general effect of the Play, I beg leave to offer my sincerest and warmest thanks.</rdg>

               <app>
                  <rdg wit="#R1837">The plot of this tragedy is founded on the history of Nicholas Rienzi, which Gibbon has described with such eloquence and power in the last volume of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire; and on the interesting account of his eventful career, contained in the second volume of L’Abbe de Sade’s Memoires pour servir a la Vie de Petrarque. The subject itself involves no very high degree of tragic interest. A plebeian band, struggling for liberty against two haughty an insolent factions—regaining it—becoming in turn the masters of their tyrants—using their freedom as an instrument of crueltly and oppression—and, with that fickleness and ingratitude wbich mark their character, turning their vengeance on the very idol on wbose head they would have lavished the names of senator or consul, of king or emperor. Thus, the oft told tale of aristocratical tyranny, and popular retribution, is again brought to our view. We hear the proud defiance of nobility, the spirit-stirring appeals of insulted patriotism, and the deafening shouts of a furious multitude, who hope much and understand little. But we miss the granduer of the Roman patron, the lofty bearing of the ancient patroit, who lived but for his country’s glory; and though the scene is laid in Rome, it is Rome in her most degenerate days, when torn and divided by contending factions: her race of heroes extinct, she was about to fall prey of fierce barbarians, and exhibit, in the solemn desolation of her seven hills—in her stately and majestic ruins, the most awful spectacle of the instability of human greatness in the history of mankind.</rdg>

                  <rdg wit="#R1837">Rienzi, or as he styled himself in his theatrical pagents, “Tribune August,” and “Deliverer of Rome,” was a <!-- page break --> man descended from the lowest dregs of the people, the offspring of an innkeeper and a washerwoman.  Having received from his parents the extraordinary gift of a liberal education, and from nature an inquiring, active, and intelligent mind, he raised himself from his obscure abd mean condition, to places both of honour adn profit: yet concealing, like the elder Brutus, under the mask of folly, and the character of a buffoon, a spirit that deepply deplored his country’s wrongs, and only wanted an opportunity to redress and avange them.  In the feud between the rival houses of the Colonna and Ursini, he discovers some glimpse of the deliverence of Rome.  A citizen who had refused to shout and throw up his ready cap during a triumphal procession of the latter party, is assaulted for his contumely. Rienzi, stung with rage at teh indignity offered to a Roman citizen, strike the offender to the ground—harangues the populace on their many and bitter wrongs—contrasts their ancient glory with their present degeneracy—rallies, expostulates, fires—and calls upon them to meet him at midnight on  the Capitoline Hill. The summons obeyed—the spark of patriotism once kindled in their bosoms, their oppressors are instantly put down—Rienzi is elected Tribune of the people—justice, clemecy, and equal laws are promised to all—and the prostrate glories of the imperial city seem about to revive. But, as is the case in most revolutions, the downfall of one tyrant is only a prelude to the elevation of a still greater:—The Rienzi, invested with authority and power, is no longer the patroitic citizen, anxious only for the deliverance of his country: his nature is changed with his fortune; blinded and hurried on by sudden greatness, he becomes vain, sensual, arrogant, and cruel; affecting pomp and pageantry, violating the most sacred rites and symbols of religion; and exhibiting, in a still more odious degree, all the vices of the deposed faction, till, by a series of provocations, he offends the nobles beyond all hope of forgiveness; and by his pride intemperance, and pusillanimity, draws upon himself the hatred and contempt of the people; and from having been their champion and defender, he becomes, by an easy transition, their victim and sacrifice. Rienzi is drawn with great power: his courage, patroitism, and paternal tenderness, are finely brought out; while the vices that darken and degrade his character are shaded with such a skilful hand, that we cannot but regret, though we are fain to acknowledge the justice of his fall:—</rdg>

                  <rdg wit="#R1837">In a drama founded on history, some allowance may be <!-- page break -->made for a departure from facts, when the interest of the scene demands it.  Shakespeare never has recourse to invention when history is sufficient for his purpose: but, when its details prove tedious and unimportant, he augments or diminishes at his pleasure; still keeping in view the leading incidents, and preserving, as regards fable and character, the truth and spirit of his original. Miss Mitford has done no more than this; and, had she done less, her tragedy had been deficient in interest and effect. The female characters are entirely her own: the wily, imperious Lady Colonna; the delicate impassioned Claudia.  The latter conception is eminently beautiful, and in perfect harmony with elegant mind form when it emanated.  It combines  sweetness, simplicity, and grace, with an heroic spirit tha aptly discovers itself in the most interesting crisis of the play:</rdg>
