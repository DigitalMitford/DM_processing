            <note>This edition compares Mitford's manuscript against the published text of 1834.
               <!--Check other published versions: Cumberland's acting copy? --> Variants are
               recorded from the manuscript held in the British Library, originally submitted in
               1825 to the Examiner's office.</note>
            <note>The hand in the manuscript is Mary Russell Mitford's. Mitford tends to write out
               the full character names, whereas published versions abbreviate. For this variant
               edition, we are not recording distinctions in delineating the speaker names in the
               manuscript vs. published version when the speakers are identical.</note>

               sequence from 1 to 85. A second hand in pencil has renumbered the folio pages for

            <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary.

         <div type="preface">
            <head>PREFACE</head>
            <p>In the following Play I have, without any such praiseworthy
                     intention on my own part, obeyed to the very letter the well-known <persName ref="#Horace">Horatio</persName>n precept-- "keep your piece nine
                     years!"</p>
            <p>The attempt to dramatize <rs type="event" ref="#regicide">one of the most
                        striking events in English History</rs>, and to delineate <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">one of the most remarkable characters</persName> that
                     ever figured on the great Theatre of Life, was originally suggested to me by
                     Mr. <persName ref="#Macready_Wm"> Macready</persName>, whose earnest
                     recommendation to try my hand on <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName>, was at a subsequent period stil more strongly enforced
                     by Mr. <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Charles Kemble</persName>; neither of those
                     gentlemen, whose judgment in dramatic affairs will hardly be disputed, having
                     foreseen any objection to such an experiment on the part of the Licenser or the
                     Lord Chamberlain. How indeed could they have anticipated any obstacle from that
                     quarter, when an acted Tragedy on the same story and bearing he same title,
                     written above sixty years ago by Mr.
                    <persName ref="#Havard_Wm">Havard</persName>, and frequently played in by Mr.
                        <persName ref="#Kemble_JP">John Kemble</persName>, was already in possession
                     of the stage, and might have been performed without let or hindrance on any
                     night at any Theatre whether in Town or Country?</p>
            <p>Unforeseen as it was however, such an obstacle unfortunately
                     arose. Mr. <persName ref="#Colman_the_Younger">Colman</persName> did object not
                     to the details or the execution of the piece but to the title and the subject,
                     and as the <persName ref="#Duke_Montrose">Duke of Montrose</persName>, the then
                     Lord Chamberlain, confirmed the decision of his "Reader of Plays," <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">we</persName> submitted to the fiat without complain
                     though not without remonstrance, and the Tragedy, instead of being produced at
                     Covent Garden eight seasons ago, has remained unacted and unpublished, with
                     little apparent chance of representation, until the spirited Managers of the
                     Victoria Theatre applied to me for permission to bring it forward on a stage
                     honourably distinguished in this age of opera and spectacle by its
                     encouragement of the legitimate drama.</p>
            <p>. In acceding to their proposal I beg most earnestly
                     and sincerely to disavow having been influenced by any thing like a spirit of
                     defiance toward the Licenser or his oiffice. To the present Lord Chamberlain
                     the whole theatrical world, and I myself more particularly, owe nothing but
                     respect and gratitute. Under his administration a similar case can hardly
                     occur; since, however, a characteristic delicacy might have withheld him from
                     rescinding a declared resolution or nullifying a positive decree of his noble
                     predecessor, the Duke of Devonshire is too eminent for liberality and kindness,
                     too tasteful and enlightened a patron of the acted Drama, to be led by the fear
                     of an imaginary danger into placing fetters and shackles on an art which he
                     loves. He is far more likely to foster and cherish in an attempt to pursue at a
                     humble distance, the track of those master poets of all countries, who from the
                     first Trgedy of Eschylus down to this very hour, have found the subjects of
                     their noblest plays in the heart-stirring convulsions, the dark and dangerous
                     conspiracies, the bold and daring usurpations, the parricides, and the
                        <orgName>Regicides</orgName> of their national annals.</p>
            <p>That Mr. <persName ref="#Colman_the_Younger">Colman</persName>'s
                     scruples arose from no ill-will to the writer, but were the offspring of an
                     honest timidity, an over-zealous fear, I do not for a moment question. A
                     Licenser must needs be somewhat of an alarmist in virtue of his office. But he
                     who apprehends danger to the Monarchy from the representation of this Play,
                     because it embodies the trial and condemnation of <persName ref="#ChasI">Charles
                        the First</persName>, will do well to suppress, if he can, <bibl corresp="#HistEngland_Hume">the striking
                     narrative of <persName ref="#hume">Hume</persName>
               </bibl>. In the present universal diffusion of
                     literature and general knowledge, the Stage has lost much of its ancient
                     influence over the feelings and passions of the multitude. That democratic
                     engine the Press, has swept away the regal supremacy of the drama. And even if
                     the Theatre were as powerful as in the days of old,--if the tendency of this
                     Play were revolutionary, which I deny,--and if <persName ref="#Cromwell">Cromwells</persName> were "plenty as
                     blackberries," which I must be permitted to doubt,--against such a King as
                     <persName ref="#WilliamIV">William the Fourth</persName>, their shafts would fall harmless.
                     The Monarch who has earned, as he has done, the honest love of a whole people,
                     may defy the subtlest attacks of fanaticism and rebellion. </p>
            <p> Of the Tragedy, considered as a literary production, I shall
                     say little: that is before the reader, and must speak for itself. No one can be
                     more conscious than I am of its numerous defects, and still more numerous
                     deficiencies; but great as those faults may be, they are not the result of
                     negligence or carelessness. It would be the worst of all pedantries, female
                     pedantry, were I to enumerate the very many cotemporary writers, the Histories,
                     Memoirs, Narratives, and State Papers, the Roundhead Sermons and Cavalier
                     Ballads from which I have endeavoured to gather not merely an accurate outline
                     of this great event, but those minute and apparently trifling touches which
                     might serve to realize the scene, and supply, by a vivid impression of the
                     people and the time, the usual sources of dramatic attraction, the interest of
                     story and suspense, from which I was cut off by the nature of my subject.</p>
            <p>Many of these allusions, those for instance to the <rs type="event">papers concealed in the stuffing of the saddle, </rs> — to
                        <rs type="event">the sowing of the melon seeds</rs>, — to <persName ref="#ChasI">Charles</persName>'s <rs type="event">constant perusal of
                           <persName ref="#Shakespeare">Shakespeare</persName>
               </rs> whilst in prison, so prettily recorded by <persName ref="#Milton">Milton</persName>, and to the falling of the head of the king's staff in
                     the trial scene, — are mentioned by the best writers, and will be immediately
                     recognized by all who are any ways conversant with the histories of the time.
                     The anecdote of Lord <persName ref="#Broghill">Broghill</persName> (afterwards
                     Earl of Orrery) , which really happened at a subsequent
                     period, is less generally known. He was in London on a mission from
                        <persName ref="#ChasII">Charles the Second</persName> during the early part of the
                     Protectorate, when <persName ref="#Cromwell">Cromwell</persName> discovered,
                     confronted, converted, and employed him, much in the manner that I have
                     related.</p>
            <p>The materials of the scene of <rs type="event">signing the
                        warrant</rs>, in which I believe that I have given, from the marking of
                        <persName ref="#Marten">Marten</persName>'s cheek to the guiding of
                        <persName ref="#Ingoldsby">Ingoldsby</persName>'s hand, a very faithful version of what
                     actually occurred, are chiefly taken from the Defences in the Trials of the
                        <orgName>Regicides</orgName>. It is certain that the Judges, after the
                     condemnation, were panic-struck at their own act ; and that but for an
                     extraordinary exertion of his singular power over the minds of all with whom he
                     came in contact, <persName ref="#Cromwell">Cromwell</persName> would never have succeeded in
                        <rs type="event">obtaining the signatures of the <orgName ref="#High_Court_of_Justice">Commissioners</orgName> of the
                           <orgName ref="#High_Court_of_Justice">High Court of Justice</orgName> to an instrument</rs> essential to the completion of <rs type="event">this great national
                        crime</rs>, and to the purposes of his own ambition.</p>
            <p>I am not aware of having in any material point departed from the
                     truth of History, except in shortening <rs type="event">the trial</rs>, in
                     bringing the <persName ref="#Queen_Ch1">Queen</persName> to
                        <placeName ref="#England">England</placeName>, and in assigning to
                        <persName ref="#Queen_Ch1">Henrietta</persName> the <rs type="event">interruption of the
                        sentence</rs>, which was actually occasioned by <persName ref="#LadyFairfax">Lady Fairfax</persName>; deviations, which were vitally
                     necessary to the effect of the drama. I have some doubts also whether <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName> did really <rs type="event">get
                        rid of <persName ref="#Fairfax">Fairfax</persName> by dismissing him and
                           <persName ref="#Harrison">Harrison</persName> to " seek the Lord
                        together." </rs>
               <bibl corresp="#HistEngland_Hume">
                  <persName ref="#hume">Hume</persName> tells the story confidently; but
                        <persName ref="#hume">Hume</persName>, although the most delightful, is by
                     no means the most accurate of historians</bibl> ; and the manner in which we are, by
                     the casual mention of contemporary writers, as well "as by the evidence on the
                     different trials, enabled to account for almost every instant of <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName>'s time during <rs type="event">that eventful morning</rs>, goes far in my mind to disprove the
                     circumstance. But the incident is highly dramatic, and so strictly in keeping
                     with the characters of all parties, that I have no scruple in assuming it as a
                     fact. The thing might have happened, if it did not, and that is excuse enough
                     for the dramatist, although not for the historian. PAGE 5--&gt;</p>
