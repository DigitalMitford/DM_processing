            <p><span class="prose">
                  <span class="#pubC1">In the following Play I have, without any such praiseworthy
                     intention on my own part, obeyed to the very letter the well-known Horation  precept-- "keep your piece nine
                     years!"</span>
                  </span></p>
            
            <p><span class="prose">
                  <span class="#pubC1">The attempt to dramatize one of the most
                     striking events in English History, and to delineate one of the most remarkable characters that
                     ever figured on the great Theatre of Life, was originally suggested to me by
                     Mr.  Macready, whose earnest
                     recommendation to try my hand on Cromwell, was at a subsequent period stil more strongly enforced
                     by Mr. Charles Kemble; neither of those
                     gentlemen, whose judgment in dramatic affairs will hardly be disputed, having
                     foreseen any objection to such an experiment on the part of the Licenser or the
                     Lord Chamberlain. How indeed could they have anticipated any obstacle from that
                     quarter, when an acted Tragedy on the same story and bearing he same title,
                     written above sixty years ago by Mr.
                     Havard, and frequently played in by Mr.
                     John Kemble, was already in possession
                     of the stage, and might have been performed without let or hindrance on any
                     night at any Theatre whether in Town or Country?</span>
                  </span></p>
            
            <p><span class="prose">
                  <span class="#pubC1">Unforeseen as it was however, such an obstacle unfortunately
                     arose. Mr. Colman did object not
                     to the details or the execution of the piece but to the title and the subject,
                     and as the Duke of Montrose, the then
                     Lord Chamberlain, confirmed the decision of his "Reader of Plays," we submitted to the fiat without complain
                     though not without remonstrance, and the Tragedy, instead of being produced at
                     Covent Garden eight seasons ago, has remained unacted and unpublished, with
                     little apparent chance of representation, until the spirited Managers of the
                     Victoria Theatre applied to me for permission to bring it forward on a stage
                     honourably distinguished in this age of opera and spectacle by its
                     encouragement of the legitimate drama.</span>
                  </span></p>
            
            <p><span class="prose">
                  <span class="#pubC1">.  In acceding to their proposal I beg most earnestly
                     and sincerely to disavow having been influenced by any thing like a spirit of
                     defiance toward the Licenser or his oiffice. To the present Lord Chamberlain
                     the whole theatrical world, and I myself more particularly, owe nothing but
                     respect and gratitute. Under his administration a similar case can hardly
                     occur; since, however, a characteristic delicacy might have withheld him from
                     rescinding a declared resolution or nullifying a positive decree of his noble
                     predecessor, the Duke of Devonshire is too eminent for liberality and kindness,
                     too tasteful and enlightened a patron of the acted Drama, to be led by the fear
                     of an imaginary danger into placing fetters and shackles on an art which he
                     loves. He is far more likely to foster and cherish in an attempt to pursue at a
                     humble distance, the track of those master poets of all countries, who from the
                     first Trgedy of Eschylus down to this very hour, have found the subjects of
                     their noblest plays in the heart-stirring convulsions, the dark and dangerous
                     conspiracies, the bold and daring usurpations, the parricides, and the
                     Regicides of their national annals.</span>
                  </span></p>
            
            <p><span class="prose">
                  <span class="#pubC1">That Mr. Colman's
                     scruples arose from no ill-will to the writer, but were the offspring of an
                     honest timidity, an over-zealous fear, I do not for a moment question. A
                     Licenser must needs be somewhat of an alarmist in virtue of his office. But he
                     who apprehends danger to the Monarchy from the representation of this Play,
                     because it embodies the trial and condemnation of Charles
                     the First, will do well to suppress, if he can, the striking
                     narrative of Hume
                     . In the present universal diffusion of
                     literature and general knowledge, the Stage has lost much of its ancient
                     influence over the feelings and passions of the multitude. That democratic
                     engine the Press, has swept away the regal supremacy of the drama. And even if
                     the Theatre were as powerful as in the days of old,--if the tendency of this
                     Play were revolutionary, which I deny,--and if Cromwells were "plenty as
                     blackberries," which I must be permitted to doubt,--against such a King as
                     William the Fourth, their shafts would fall harmless.
                     The Monarch who has earned, as he has done, the honest love of a whole people,
                     may defy the subtlest attacks of fanaticism and rebellion. </span>
                  </span></p>
            
            <p><span class="prose">
                  <span class="#pubC1"> Of the Tragedy, considered as a literary production, I shall
                     say little: that is before the reader, and must speak for itself. No one can be
                     more conscious than I am of its numerous defects, and still more numerous
                     deficiencies; but great as those faults may be, they are not the result of
                     negligence or carelessness. It would be the worst of all pedantries, female
                     pedantry, were I to enumerate the very many cotemporary writers, the Histories,
                     Memoirs, Narratives, and State Papers, the Roundhead Sermons and Cavalier
                     Ballads from which I have endeavoured to gather not merely an accurate outline
                     of this great event, but those minute and apparently trifling touches which
                     might serve to realize the scene, and supply, by a vivid impression of the
                     people and the time, the usual sources of dramatic attraction, the interest of
                     story and suspense, from which I was cut off by the nature of my subject.</span>

            <p><span class="prose">
                  <span class="#pubC1">Many of these allusions, those for instance to the papers concealed in the stuffing of the saddle,  — to
                     the sowing of the melon seeds, — to Charles's constant perusal of
                     Shakespeare
                      whilst in prison, so prettily recorded by Milton, and to the falling of the head of the king's staff in
                     the trial scene, — are mentioned by the best writers, and will be immediately
                     recognized by all who are any ways conversant with the histories of the time.
                     The anecdote of Lord Broghill (afterwards
                     Earl of Orrery) , which really happened at a subsequent
                     period, is less generally known. He was in London on a mission from
                     Charles the Second during the early part of the
                     Protectorate, when Cromwell discovered,
                     confronted, converted, and employed him, much in the manner that I have
                     related.</span>

                  <span class="#pubC1">The materials of the scene of signing the
                     warrant, in which I believe that I have given, from the marking of
                     Marten's cheek to the guiding of
                     Ingoldsby's hand, a very faithful version of what
                     actually occurred, are chiefly taken from the Defences in the Trials of the
                     Regicides. It is certain that the Judges, after the
                     condemnation, were panic-struck at their own act ; and that but for an
                     extraordinary exertion of his singular power over the minds of all with whom he
                     came in contact, Cromwell would never have succeeded in
                     obtaining the signatures of the Commissioners of the
                     High Court of Justice to an instrument
                     essential to the completion of this great national
                     crime, and to the purposes of his own ambition.</span>

                     Henrietta the interruption of the
                     sentence, which was actually occasioned by Lady Fairfax; deviations, which were vitally
                     necessary to the effect of the drama. I have some doubts also whether Cromwell did really get
                     rid of Fairfax by dismissing him and
                     Harrison to " seek the Lord
                     together." 
                     
                     Hume tells the story confidently ; but
                     Hume, although the most delightful, is by
                     no means the most accurate of historians ; and the manner in which we are, by
                     the casual mention of contemporary writers, as well "as by the evidence on the
                     different trials, enabled to account for almost every instant of Cromwell's time during that eventful morning, goes far in my mind to disprove the
                     circumstance. But the incident is highly dramatic, and so strictly in keeping
                     with the characters of all parties, that I have no scruple in assuming it as a
                     fact. The thing might have happened, if it did not, and that is excuse enough
                     for the dramatist, although not for the historian. PAGE 5--&gt;</span>

            To G. Colman Esqre
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            PREFACE
            
            
            In the following Play I have, without any such praiseworthy
            intention on my own part, obeyed to the very letter the well-known Horation  precept-- "keep your piece nine
            years!"
            
            
            The attempt to dramatize one of the most
            striking events in English History, and to delineate one of the most remarkable characters that
            ever figured on the great Theatre of Life, was originally suggested to me by
            Mr.  Macready, whose earnest
            recommendation to try my hand on Cromwell, was at a subsequent period stil more strongly enforced
            by Mr. Charles Kemble; neither of those
            gentlemen, whose judgment in dramatic affairs will hardly be disputed, having
            foreseen any objection to such an experiment on the part of the Licenser or the
            Lord Chamberlain. How indeed could they have anticipated any obstacle from that
            quarter, when an acted Tragedy on the same story and bearing he same title,
            written above sixty years ago by Mr.
            Havard, and frequently played in by Mr.
            John Kemble, was already in possession
            of the stage, and might have been performed without let or hindrance on any
            night at any Theatre whether in Town or Country?
            
            
            Unforeseen as it was however, such an obstacle unfortunately
            arose. Mr. Colman did object not
            to the details or the execution of the piece but to the title and the subject,
            and as the Duke of Montrose, the then
            Lord Chamberlain, confirmed the decision of his "Reader of Plays," we submitted to the fiat without complain
            though not without remonstrance, and the Tragedy, instead of being produced at
            Covent Garden eight seasons ago, has remained unacted and unpublished, with
            little apparent chance of representation, until the spirited Managers of the
            Victoria Theatre applied to me for permission to bring it forward on a stage
            honourably distinguished in this age of opera and spectacle by its
            encouragement of the legitimate drama.
            
            
            .  In acceding to their proposal I beg most earnestly
            and sincerely to disavow having been influenced by any thing like a spirit of
            defiance toward the Licenser or his oiffice. To the present Lord Chamberlain
            the whole theatrical world, and I myself more particularly, owe nothing but
            respect and gratitute. Under his administration a similar case can hardly
            occur; since, however, a characteristic delicacy might have withheld him from
            rescinding a declared resolution or nullifying a positive decree of his noble
            predecessor, the Duke of Devonshire is too eminent for liberality and kindness,
            too tasteful and enlightened a patron of the acted Drama, to be led by the fear
            of an imaginary danger into placing fetters and shackles on an art which he
            loves. He is far more likely to foster and cherish in an attempt to pursue at a
            humble distance, the track of those master poets of all countries, who from the
            first Trgedy of Eschylus down to this very hour, have found the subjects of
            their noblest plays in the heart-stirring convulsions, the dark and dangerous
            conspiracies, the bold and daring usurpations, the parricides, and the
            Regicides of their national annals.
            
            
            That Mr. Colman's
            scruples arose from no ill-will to the writer, but were the offspring of an
            honest timidity, an over-zealous fear, I do not for a moment question. A
            Licenser must needs be somewhat of an alarmist in virtue of his office. But he
            who apprehends danger to the Monarchy from the representation of this Play,
            because it embodies the trial and condemnation of Charles
            the First, will do well to suppress, if he can, the striking
            narrative of Hume
            . In the present universal diffusion of
            literature and general knowledge, the Stage has lost much of its ancient
            influence over the feelings and passions of the multitude. That democratic
            engine the Press, has swept away the regal supremacy of the drama. And even if
            the Theatre were as powerful as in the days of old,--if the tendency of this
            Play were revolutionary, which I deny,--and if Cromwells were "plenty as
            blackberries," which I must be permitted to doubt,--against such a King as
            William the Fourth, their shafts would fall harmless.
            The Monarch who has earned, as he has done, the honest love of a whole people,
            may defy the subtlest attacks of fanaticism and rebellion. 
            
            
             Of the Tragedy, considered as a literary production, I shall
            say little: that is before the reader, and must speak for itself. No one can be
            more conscious than I am of its numerous defects, and still more numerous
            deficiencies; but great as those faults may be, they are not the result of
            negligence or carelessness. It would be the worst of all pedantries, female
            pedantry, were I to enumerate the very many cotemporary writers, the Histories,
            Memoirs, Narratives, and State Papers, the Roundhead Sermons and Cavalier
            Ballads from which I have endeavoured to gather not merely an accurate outline
            of this great event, but those minute and apparently trifling touches which
            might serve to realize the scene, and supply, by a vivid impression of the
            people and the time, the usual sources of dramatic attraction, the interest of
            story and suspense, from which I was cut off by the nature of my subject.
            
            
            Many of these allusions, those for instance to the papers concealed in the stuffing of the saddle,  — to
            the sowing of the melon seeds, — to Charles's constant perusal of
            Shakespeare
             whilst in prison, so prettily recorded by Milton, and to the falling of the head of the king's staff in
            the trial scene, — are mentioned by the best writers, and will be immediately
            recognized by all who are any ways conversant with the histories of the time.
            The anecdote of Lord Broghill (afterwards
            Earl of Orrery) , which really happened at a subsequent
            period, is less generally known. He was in London on a mission from
            Charles the Second during the early part of the
            Protectorate, when Cromwell discovered,
            confronted, converted, and employed him, much in the manner that I have
            related.
            
            
            The materials of the scene of signing the
            warrant, in which I believe that I have given, from the marking of
            Marten's cheek to the guiding of
            Ingoldsby's hand, a very faithful version of what
            actually occurred, are chiefly taken from the Defences in the Trials of the
            Regicides. It is certain that the Judges, after the
            condemnation, were panic-struck at their own act ; and that but for an
            extraordinary exertion of his singular power over the minds of all with whom he
            came in contact, Cromwell would never have succeeded in
            obtaining the signatures of the Commissioners of the
            High Court of Justice to an instrument
            essential to the completion of this great national
            crime, and to the purposes of his own ambition.
            
            
            I am not aware of having in any material point departed from the
            truth of History, except in shortening the trial, in
            bringing the Queen to
            England, and in assigning to
            Henrietta the interruption of the
            sentence, which was actually occasioned by Lady Fairfax; deviations, which were vitally
            necessary to the effect of the drama. I have some doubts also whether Cromwell did really get
            rid of Fairfax by dismissing him and
            Harrison to " seek the Lord
            together." 
            
            Hume tells the story confidently ; but
            Hume, although the most delightful, is by
            no means the most accurate of historians ; and the manner in which we are, by
            the casual mention of contemporary writers, as well "as by the evidence on the
            different trials, enabled to account for almost every instant of Cromwell's time during that eventful morning, goes far in my mind to disprove the
            circumstance. But the incident is highly dramatic, and so strictly in keeping
            with the characters of all parties, that I have no scruple in assuming it as a
            fact. The thing might have happened, if it did not, and that is excuse enough
            for the dramatist, although not for the historian. PAGE 5--&gt;

            The world's historic glories and the fate
            Of kings, and, loftier far, the stern debate
            Of passions; greater still, the ocean tide
            Of thoughts and principles; events that ride
            Upon that mighty flood; lights of the past
            That dial-shadows on the future cast,
            These Tragedy, wise, solemn, stern, pourtrays
            In the Greek verse sublime, in Shakespeare's native lays.
            Oh, English Harry! did the battle-field
            Of Agincourt so proud a trophy yield
            As the high heart, the generous thought which he
            Hath shrin'd thee in for all eternity?
            
            
            Man and the truth are our proud Muse's theme:
            No witchcraft vision, no light fairy dream
            Calls up the spirit of Charles, and bids it
            pass
            As a dim shadow o'er the magic glass;
            Even as he was he is, sealing with blood
            
            The right divine of kings; she, whom he wooed
            In his few hours of joy and mirth, is here,
            And weeps their sufferings in no fancied tear,
            A thing whose beauty is fragility,
            Wrestling with iron-handed destiny:
            And, as though Destiny himself, exprest
            In some dark human form, had come to wrest
            Sceptres and powers and love and lives from men,
            Here, all-controlling, Cromwell stands
            again.
            
            
            And can these mighty scenes with trembling hand
            Be painted? or in colours such as stand
            One moment in the rainbow, soft and fair?
            Can curious words these awful themes declare?
            No: firm the hand and bold must be the pen
            That wields the passions of those fearful men
            Whose bold hypocrisy dar'd Heaven and Hell:
            Even as they spoke, their speech the Muse shall tell;
            Poor pigmy fear this story must disgrace,
            The Titan warrings of a giant race.
