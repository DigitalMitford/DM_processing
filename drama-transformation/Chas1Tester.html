                           Mr. Macready, whose earnest recommendation to try my hand on Cromwell, was at a subsequent period stil more strongly enforced by Mr. Charles Kemble; neither of those gentlemen, whose judgment in dramatic affairs will hardly be disputed,
                           having foreseen any objection to such an experiment on the part of the Licenser or the Lord Chamberlain. How indeed could they have anticipated any obstacle from that quarter, when an acted
                           Tragedy on the same story and bearing the same title, written above sixty years ago
                           by Mr. Havard, and frequently played in by Mr. John Kemble, was already in possession of the stage, and might have been performed without let

                                 traffic expected from the new bridge. It was purchased in 1833 by Daniel Egerton and

                           been influenced by any thing like a spirit of defiance toward the Licenser or his
                           office. To the present Lord Chamberlain the whole theatrical world, and I myself more particularly, owe nothing but respect
                           and gratitude. Under his administration a similar case can hardly occur; since, however,
                           a characteristic delicacy might have withheld him from rescinding a declared resolution
                           or nullifying a positive decree of his noble predecessor, the Duke of Devonshire is too eminent for liberality and kindness, too tasteful and enlightened a patron
                           of the acted Drama, to be led by the fear of an imaginary danger into placing fetters
                           and shackles on an art which he loves. He is far more likely to foster and cherish
                           in an attempt to pursue at a humble distance, the track of those master poets of all
                           countries, who from the first Tragedy of <span class="sic">Eschylus</span><span class="reg">Aeschylus</span> down to this very hour, have found the subjects of their noblest plays in the heart-stirring
                           convulsions, the dark and dangerous conspiracies, the bold and daring usurpations,
                           the parricides, and the Regicides of their national annals.</span></span></span></span></p>
            
            
            <p><span class="prose"><span class="app"><span class="var"><span class="wit"><span class="witLabel">#pubC1: </span>That Mr. Colman's scruples arose from no ill-will to the writer, but were the offspring of an honest
                           timidity, an over-zealous fear, I do not for a moment question. A Licenser must needs
                           be somewhat of an alarmist in virtue of his office. But he who apprehends danger to
                           the Monarchy from the representation of this Play, because it embodies the trial and condemnation of Charles the First, will do well to suppress, if he can, the striking narrative of Hume. In the present universal diffusion of literature and general knowledge, the Stage
                           has lost much of its ancient influence over the feelings and passions of the multitude.
                           That democratic engine the Press, has swept away the regal supremacy of the drama.
                           And even if the Theatre were as powerful as in the days of old,—if the tendency of
                           this Play were revolutionary, which I deny,—and if Cromwells were <span class="q">plenty as blackberries,</span><span id="Note6" class="anchor">[6] <span class="note" id="n6">Falstaff from Henry IV, part one: "If reasons were as plentiful as blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon

                                 | An island in the English Channel off the coast of Hampshire. Was
                                 earlier owned by a Norman family and a kingdom in its own right until 1293.
                                 Until 1890, it was part of the county of Hampshire, and it shared a Lord Lieutenant
                                 with that county
                                 until 1974. Until 1995, the island, like Jersey and Guernsey, also had a
                                 governor. The Island is now considered its own administrative county.--#lmw50.69384789999999 -1.3047340000000531</span></span>.</span></span></span>
