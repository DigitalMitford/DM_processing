         <p>TEI P5 conformant: We are coding this to compare the manuscript of the play submitted
				to the Lord Chamberlain's office with the published version, using the witness
				encoding apparatus provided by the TEI. Page breaks recorded here are in the
				manuscript version. We have not indicated the change in abbreviation of character
				names from manuscript to print, since these seem insignificant, but rather have
				concentrated on recording variations in punctuation, word choice, and lineation of
				speeches.</p>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>In representing Mitford's manuscript, Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

            <l n="3">Tho' doubts and hopes, and tremblings do not fail,</l>
            <l n="4">The points fall flatly, and the rhymes grow stale,</l>
            <l n="5">Why should the Author hint their fitting parts,</l>
            <l n="6">In all the pomp of verse to "British Hearts"?</l>
            <l n="7">Why to such minds as yours with ardour pray</l>

            <l n="11">How hangs the scale 'twixt agony and joy,</l>
            <l n="12">What bliss you nourish, or what hopes destroy?</l>
            <l n="13">All these you feel;--and yet we scarce can bring</l>
            <l n="14">A prologue to-- "the posey of a Ring"</l>
            <l n="15">To what <emph>may</emph> we allude? Our plot untold,</l>
            <l n="16">Is no great chapter from the times of old;</l>
            <l n="17">On no august association rests,</l>

            <l n="19">Its scene, as inauspicious to our strain,</l>
            <l n="20">Is neither mournful Greece, nor kindling Spain,</l>
            <l n="21">But Sicily--where no defiance hurl'd</l>
            <l n="22">At freedom's foes may awe the attending world.</l>
            <l n="23">But since old forms forbid us to submit</l>
            <l n="24">A Play, without a Prologue, to the Pit;</l>
            <l n="25">Lest this be missed by some true friend of plays,</l>

            <l n="15">Our tender bosoms learn in song to melt,</l>
            <l n="16">And send their griefs to press--as soon as felt;</l>
            <l n="17">No thought in lone obscurity decays,</l>
            <l n="18">But dies away in neatly publish'd lays;</l>
            <l n="19">No tender hope can bloom and fade unseen,</l>
            <l n="20">It leaves its fragrance--in a magazine;</l>
            <l n="21">The bashful heart, whom deep emotions bless,</l>
            <l n="22">Hides its soft secrets in the daily press;</l>
            <l n="23">With hints of well-assum'd despair beguiles,</l>
            <l n="24">And execrates mankind to win their smiles;</l>
            <l n="25">A woman sure may claim no small compassion,</l>
            <l n="26">Who has this plea,--she's only in the fashion.</l>
            <l n="27"> O, if the fair's prerogative it be,</l>
            <l n="28">To watch supreme o'er calumny and tea;</l>
            <l n="29">To slay an Author's hopes with daintiest sneers,</l>

            <l n="31">Regard not <emph>her</emph> unwomanly who seeks</l>
            <l n="32">To draw down sacred tears o'er beauty's cheeks,</l>
            <l n="33">Who for her sex, by artless scenes, would keep</l>
            <l n="34">Its dearest right--to weep with those that weep;</l>
            <l n="35">Who if, to-night her humble muse hath brought</l>
            <l n="36">To some sad heart a train of gentle thought,</l>
            <l n="37">On some worn spirit shed that blest relief,</l>
            <l n="38">A generous sympathy with kindred grief,</l>
            <l n="39">With joy retires to life's secluded ways,</l>

The header of the list is different in each version, simply being marked as "Characters" in the printed version, with the more dramatic flair on the side of the manuscript. The other major difference is that the printed version includes the cast, whereas the manuscript only shows the characters, themselves.
