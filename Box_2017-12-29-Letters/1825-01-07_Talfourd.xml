Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

               in hoping to meet you on Monday spoke rather from my wishes than from rational
               expectation, therefore I should not imagine they would be offended if you did
               not go--but I am quite sure that to see you whether they have written or not
