               way of liking plays by going every night &amp; giving them a fair chance--Certain in

               Patriot. <title ref="#Wallace_play">Wallace</title> is very well-- considering--a
               good deal of stage effect--&amp; some fine situations -- there is no promise in
               it--no luxuriance to prune away -- no glorious faults--the author will never write
               better--but as he never means to write again that does not much signify--he got up
               these two things merely to earn money enough to pay his expenses at <placeName

               person -- as little like the real <title ref="#Wallace_play">Wallace</title> as her
               hero--always praising &amp; puffing himself &amp; talking sentimentally to the woods
               &amp; mountains &amp; dropping his sword at the sound of treachery (the real Wallace
               would have cloven men into the earth first &amp; been shocked at this treachery
               afterwards) &amp; leaving his fate to this wife's decision &amp; so forth. To redeem
               these faults he had two great merits--he was born before the invention of gunpowder,
               &amp; he is acted by <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">W. Macready</persName>--who to say
