           <handNote corresp="#pencil" medium="pencil">Someone, apparently other than Mitford, who occasionally left notes in a spidery thin hand to explain or document details in Mitford's letters in the margins of her pages, noted in the manuscripts held at Reading Central Library. This may be William Harness or A. G. L'Estrange. This annotator inserts a footnote on the bottom of the first page indicating that a certain half sheet is found at the end of the letter.</handNote>
           <handNote corresp="#rc" medium="red_crayon"> Red crayon or thick red pencil. Probably a different hand from Mitford's that marks many of her letters, sometimes drawing diagonal lines across pages, and sometimes writing words overtop and perpendicularly across Mitford's writing. A red line is drawn from top left to bottom right of each of the first three leaves. There is no red crayon across leaf four.</handNote>
           <handNote corresp="#pencil" medium="pencil"> Someone, apparently other than Mitford (perhaps cataloging letters and describing them, or marking the up while creating an earlier edition of Mitford's letters), left grey pencil marks and numbered her letters now in the Reading Central Library's collection. This letter is numbered "40" in the top left of the first leaf.</handNote>

              <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

            <p>In all the variety of letters &amp; modes of letters which, we have at different times sent to one another, pray did we ever <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/></del><add>try</add> that fine classical thing a fragment? If not I have the pleasure of beginning the practice with the enclosed half <del rend="squiggles"><gap quantity="1" unit="word"/>page</del><add place="above">sheet</add>--without an end--&amp; beginning most Pindarically in the middle of a subject--"Ruin seize thee ruthless King"<note resp="#jcm">Mitford quotes from <title ref="#Bard_ode">The Bard. A Pindaric Ode</title> by <persName ref="#Gray_Thos">Thomas Gray</persName> (I.1.1-4. Bard: "'Ruin seize thee, ruthless king!/'Confusion on thy banners wait,/'Though fanned by Conquest's crimson wing/'They mock the air with idle state.")</note> is not a finer instance of abruptness.--The truth is, my dear friend, that about a week ago, I began a letter to ask you a question respecting a person whom I thought it possible you might know--but getting the information I wished from another quarter, the first page &amp; a half of my letter became useless--&amp; being as you know a great economist of time &amp; paper I tore off the un-business part of the epistle &amp; shall enclose what remains. I was talking I believe of <persName ref="#Milman_HH">Mr. Milman</persName>'s new Poem <title ref="#Martyr_Antioch">The Martyr of Antioch</title>--I know that you don't read much of things printed in uneven lines--&amp; I fancy that nine tenths of <persName ref="#Milman_HH">Mr. Milman's</persName> readers care as little for poetry as you do--only that very few have the honesty to say so--They read him for fashion--for the honour &amp; glory of reading a poem--&amp; the soberer credit of reading a good book--<choice><sic>Its</sic><reg resp="#jcm">It's</reg></choice> a sort of union of Sermon &amp; romance--a Sunday evening amusement, which Mamas tolerate &amp; Papas smile upon--&amp; the book sells--and it ought to sell for it is full of splendid passages--with only one faux pas--all the Heathen persons odes &amp; descriptions are worth a million of the Christian hymns &amp; people--indeed <persName ref="#Milman_HH">Mr. Milman</persName> has a fine sense of classical 
               <pb n="2"/> beauty--he would make a glorious thing of some old Grecian story--but then that would never make him a Dean or a Bishop--how you will not be very violently at a loss for a <choice><sic>connexion</sic><reg resp="#jcm">connection</reg></choice> with the fragment--which I have made still more of a subject for the <orgName ref="#Antiquarian_Soc">Antiquarian Society</orgName>(do you belong to that learned body?) by tearing off with my usual <choice><sic>mal-adresse</sic><reg resp="#jcm">maladresse</reg></choice> the beginnings &amp; endings of some of the lines--never mind you like riddles. <add><metamark rend="jerk"/></add> By the bye coming back to one eternal theme the <persName ref="#Scott_Wal">Author</persName> of <title ref="#Waverly">Waverley</title>--I heard a day or two back from the young American Traveller of whom I have I think elsewhere made honorable mention <note resp="#jcm">Mitford appears to have met an American with whom she corresponded, possibly <persName ref="#Willis_NP">Nathaniel Parker Willis</persName>.</note> that Captain <persName ref="#Scott_Tom">Scott</persName> is much respected by those much with him in <placeName ref="#Canada">Canada</placeName> (our Traveller aforesaid had the honour to be introduced to him) of having at least some share in the novels<note resp="#jcm"><persName ref="#Scott_Tom">Thomas Scott</persName> was rumored to have been the author of <title ref="#Waverly">Waverley</title>, or at least a major contributor to the Waverley Novels.

There is some chance that I might be able to show you <persName ref="#James_Miss">Miss James</persName>--for I think she will come to <persName ref="#Valpy_Richard">Dr. Valpy</persName>'s at Easter--&amp; when she comes for the form of the thing to <persName ref="#Valpy_Richard">D.

I think I love her better than I used to do when you used to laugh at me about her--we have ha<gap reason="torn" quantity="1" unit="chars"/><unclear><supplied resp="#jcm">d</supplied></unclear>a quarrel--in which I scolded &amp; she sulked--&amp; as <gap reason="torn" quantity="1" unit="word"/><unclear><supplied resp="#jcm">her</supplied></unclear> only fault before was being faultless the discovery of this little imperfection has only made her the more charming--besides we are more upon an equality--she knew plenty of my little imperfections before--for my faults I thank them poor things lie visibly enough upon the surface--you may run &amp; read--whilst her one sin lay buried like a tulip root at Christmas. I should like you to know her. <add><metamark rend="jerk"/></add> Was not I very pooly when I wrote to you last? Yes.
