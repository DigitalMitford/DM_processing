I say this, my dear <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William</persName>, without the least fear of contradiction from you--for <persName> Mr Windham's</persName> opinions were so different from the settled system of any party.

                 <note resp="#qar">Thomas Hope was a descendant from Scottish merchant bankers who ran Hope &amp; Co. He was a Dutch and British merchant banker, author, philosopher, and art collector. He wrote <title>Anastasius</title>, which experts (and Mitford) said rivaled the writings of Lord Byron. He came to London during the French occupation of the Netherlands and never returned to Amsterdam. In 1807 Hope published a folio of sketches of his furniture titled <title>Household Furniture and Interior Decoration</title> which had great influence on the style of upholstery and interior decoration. He also published <title>Costumes of the Ancients</title> in 1809 and <title>Designs of Modern Costumes</title> which included antiquarian research.<title>A Historical Essay on Architecture</title> was posted posthumously by the Hope family in 1835 which was based on early hope drawings. He was both ridiculed and lauded for his reputation among London aristocracy as the "costume and furniture man". </note> </person>
