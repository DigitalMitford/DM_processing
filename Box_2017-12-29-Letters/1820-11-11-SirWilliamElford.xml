               with you as to the facility of imitating Scott’s novels--We have had nothing like them yet--&amp; I do not think we soon shall. Consider, with all [scribble] his faults the great &amp; rare qualities that must be united in such a novelist &amp;-–the [uncertain]<!--SCW: "uncertain" is "minute"--> and union<!--SCW: "unions" is "curious" I'm pretty sure--> learning which [uncertain]<!--SCW: "uncertain" is "seizes"--> with the [scribbles] certainty [uncertain]<!--SCW: "uncertain" is "& ease"--> of accurate knowledge on all the antiquarian detail that [uncertain]<!--SCW: "uncertain" is "suits"--> his purpose. The almost magical power of placing scenes and forms before you as in a picture--&amp; leading you through a changing country which you trace as in a map. (This power of external representation is only equaled by Chaucer, <sic>Bocacio</sic> &amp; as far as scenery goes by Spenser)--&amp; lastly his various &amp; extraordinary delineations of character. It is quite nonsense to compare him as the Edinburgh Reviewers do to Shakespeare in this respect and gives one the tendency to underrate him that such extravagant praises by a natural re-action always do-–his Characters have not the exquisite freedom of Shakespeare’s-–there is too much identity. He is afraid to [uncertain]<!--SCW: "uncertain" is "trust"--> them out of their prescribed bounds. Afraid to let them make any speech which cannot instantly be assigned to the right person. The keeping is too exact to be true to our [uncertain]<!--SCW: "uncertain" is "mixed"--> &amp; varying nature-–[uncertain] still the characters are finely [scribbles] conceived &amp; finely drawn, &amp; there is a noble spirit of humanity an indulgence to human frailty which sets a grand lesson to the world. He makes good Shakespeare’s most beautiful saying “There is some soul of goodness in things evil.” &amp; is as far as I know the only writer who has ever had candour &amp; fairness enough to tolerate opposite bigotries. No, my dear Friend--it is not the mere [uncertain]<!--SCW: I want to supply "uncertain" as <unclear><supplied>prosing</supplied></unclear>--> on some peculiar piece of history to illustrate that will [uncertain]<!--SCW: "uncertain" is "produce"--> even in powerful hands

Margaret Holford was the author of Warbeck of Wolfstein--> I don’t think she has the slightest intention to imitate him-–Warbeck of Wolfstein seems to me an attempt to portray in very black &amp; exaggerated colours the character of Lord Bryon-–does it not strike you so? Some of the anecdotes-–that of the role with the <add place="above"><metamark place="below" function="insertion" rend="caret">orange</metamark></add> flowers for instance-–are stories which have been currently told of his Lordship, &amp; altogether I am afraid there can be no doubt but it was intended as a portrait.

Don’t you delight in the “Poetry of the Antijacobin?)-–Miss Holford wrote you know a very fine &amp; powerful Poem Wallace or the [Light?]<!--SCW: "light" is "Fight"--> of Falkirk which came out the same year with my Christina &amp; was worth a thousand of it. (Don’t contradict this-–if you do I shall think that you think I am begging for a compliment instead of telling a truth) &amp; rather think that Miss Holford’s present work is more like Miss Porter than Walter Scott.
