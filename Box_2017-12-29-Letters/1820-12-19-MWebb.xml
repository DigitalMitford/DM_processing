                     <support> <p> One sheet of <material>paper</material>, folded in half vertically and in thirds horizontally. All four surfaces contain text. The paper is 18.34cm in length and 11.34cm in height. The address directed to Miss Webb, Wokingham, appears on the first page, which is the left side of the paper; the correspondence begins on the right side and continues to cover the backside of the paper entirely.<!--Text describing the document. Include information on the material, usually thus: <material>paper</material> and the number of page surfaces photographed. So when Mitford writes over two sheets of paper on the front and back of each, we've photographed four surfaces. When she writes on one sheet front and back, we've photographed two surfaces. Work closely with the photos of your letter to determine the number of sheets and separate surfaces, and describe how they are folded: in thirds? There is likely to be more than one photo of the same surface.--> </p>

In the *following* sentence, describe red crayoning on this letter. -->A red line is drawn from top left to bottom right of each of the first three leaves. On leaf four, a red line is drawn from top left to bottom right across each of the two text blocks. There is no red crayon across the address text block.</handNote>
           <handNote corresp="#pencil" medium="pencil"> Someone, apparently other than Mitford, perhaps cataloging letters and describing them, who left grey pencil marks and numbered her letters now in the Reading Central Library's collection. <!-- Don't change the preceding sentence if this letter has grey pencil.
