            <p>October 27th.—A lovely autumnal day; the air soft, balmy, genial; the sky of that
               softened and delicate blue upon which the eye loves to rest,—the blue which gives
               such relief to the rich beauty of the earth, all around glowing in the ripe and
               mellow tints of the most gorgeous of the seasons. Really such an autumn may well
               compensate our English climate for the fine spring of the south, that spring of which
               the poets talk, but which we so seldom enjoy. Such an autumn glows upon us like a
               splendid evening; it is the very sunset of the year; and I have been tempted forth
               into a wider range of enjoyment than usual. This walk (if I may use the Irish figure
               of speech called a bull) will be a ride. A very dear friend has beguiled me into ac-
               companying her in her pretty equipage to her beautiful home, four miles off; and
               having sent forward in the<pb n=”256”/> style of a running footman the servant who
               had driven her, she assumes the reins, and off we set.</p>
            <p>My fair companion is a person whom nature and for- tune would have spoiled if they
               could. She is one of those striking women whom a stranger cannot pass without turning
               to look again; tall and finely propor- tioned, with a bold Roman contour of figure
               and fea- ture, a delicate English complexion, and an air of dis- tinction altogether
               her own. Her beauty is duchess- like. She seems born to wear feathers and diamonds,
               and to form the grace and ornament of a court; and the noble frankness and simplicity
               of her countenance and manner confirm the impression. Destiny has, however, dealt
               more kindly by her. She is the wife of a rich country gentleman of high descent and
               higher attain- ments, to whom she is most devotedly attached,—the mother of a little
               girl as lovely as herself, and the de- light of all who have the happiness of her
               acquaintance, to whom she is endeared not merely by her remarkable sweetness of
               temper and kindness of heart, but by the singular ingenuousness and openness of
               character which communicate an indescribable charm to her conversa- tion. She is as
               transparent as water. You may see every colour, every shade of a mind as lofty and
               beau- tiful as her person. Talking with her is like being in the Palace of Truth
               described by Madame de Genlis;<pb n=”257”/> and yet 80 kindly are her feelings, so
               great her in- dulgence to the little failings and foibles of our com- mon nature, so
               intense her sympathy with the wants, the wishes, the sorrows, and the happiness of
               her fel- low-creatures, that, with all her frank-speaking, I never knew her make an
               enemy or lose a friend.</p>
            <p>But we must get on. What would she say if she knew I was putting her into print? We
               must get on up the hill. Ah! that is precisely what we are not likely to do! This
               horse, this beautiful and high-bred horse, well fed, and fat and glossy, who stood
               prancing at our gate like an Arabian, has suddenly turned sulky. He does not indeed
               stand quite still, but his way of moving is little better—the slowest and most sullen
               of all walks. Even they who ply the hearse at funerals, sad-looking beasts who totter
               under black feathers, go faster. It is of no use to admonish him by whip or rein, or
               word. The rogue has found out, that it is a weak and tender hand that guides him now.
               Oh for one pull, one stroke of his old driver the groom! How he would fly! But there
               is the groom half-a-mile be- fore us, out of ear-shot, clearing the ground at a
               capital rate, beating us hollow. He has just turned the top of the hill;—and in a
               moment—aye, now he is out of sight, and will undoubtedly so continue till he meets us
               at the lawn gate. Well! there is no great harm. It is only prolonging the pleasure of
               enjoying together this<pb n=”258”/> charming scenery in this fine weather. If once we
               make up our minds not to care how slowly our steed goes, not to fret ourselves by
               vain exertions, it is no matter what his pace may be. There is little doubt of his
               getting home by sunset, and that will content us. He is, after all, a fine noble
               animal; and perhaps when he finds that we are determined to give him his way, he may
               re- lent, and give us ours. All his sex are sticklers for dominion, though, when it
               is undisputed, some of them are generous enough to abandon it. Two or three of the
               most discreet wives of my acquaintance contrive to manage their husbands sufficiently
               with no better secret than this seeming submission; and in our case the ex- ample has
               the more weight since we have no possible way of helping ourselves.</p>
            <p>Thus philosophising, we reached the top of the hill, and viewed with “reverted eyes”
               the beautiful prospect that lay bathed in golden sunshine behind us. Cowper says,
               with that boldness of expressing in poetry the commonest and simplest feelings, which
               is perhaps one great secret of his originality,<note place=”inline”>“Scenes must be
                  beautiful, which, daily seen, Please daily, and whose novelty survives Long
                  knowledge and the scrutiny of years.”</note> Every day I walk up this hill—every
               day I pause at the top to admire the broad winding road with the green<pb n=”259”/>
               waste on each side, uniting it with the thickly timbered hedgerows; the two pretty
               cottages at unequal dis- tances, placed so as to mark the bends; the village beyond,
               with its mass of roofs and clustered chimneys peeping through the trees; and the rich
               distance, where cottages, mansions, churches, towns, seem embowered in some wide
               forest, and shut in by blue shadowy hills. Every day I admire this most beautiful
               landscape; yet never did it seem to me so fine or so glowing as now. All the tints of
               the glorious autumn, orange, tawny, yellow, red, are poured in profusion amongst the
               bright greens of the meadows and turnip fields, till the eyes is satiated with
               colour; and then before us we have the common with its picturesque roughness of
               surface, tufted with cottages, dappled with water, edging off on one side into fields
               and farms and orchards, and termi- nated on the other by the princely oak avenue.
               What a richness and variety the wild broken ground gives to the luxuriant cultivation
               of the rest of the landscape! Cowper has described it for me. How perpetually, as we
               walk in the country, his vivid pictures recur to the memory! Here is his common, and
               mine!</p>
            <note place=”bottom”>“The common overgrown with fern, and rough With prickly gorse,
               that, shapeless and deform’d And dangerous to the touch, has yet its bloom, And decks
               itself with ornaments of gold;</note>
            <pb n=”260”/>
            <note place=”top”>there the turf Smells fresh, and, rich in odoriferous herbs And
               fungous fruits nf earth, regales the sense With luxury of unexpected sweets.”</note>
            <p>The description is exact There, too, to the left is my cricket-ground; (Cowper’s
               common wanted that finish- ing grace;) and there stands one solitary urchin, as if in
               contemplation of its past and future glories; for, alas! cricket is over for the
               season. Ah! it is Ben Kirby, next brother to Joe, king of the youngsters, and
               probably his successor—for this Michaelmas has cost us Joe! He is promoted from the
               farm to the mansion-house, two miles off; there he cleans shoes, rubs knives, and
               runs upon errands, and is, as his mo- ther expresses it, “a sort of ‘prentice to the
               footman.” I should not wonder if Joe, some day or other, should overtop the footman,
               and rise to be butler; and his splendid prospects must be our consolation for the
               loss of this great favourite. In the mean time we have Ben.</p>
            <p>Ben Kirby is a year younger than Joe, and the schoolfellow and rival of Jem Eusden.
               To be sure his abilities lie in rather a different line: Jem is a scholar, Ben is a
               wag: Jem is great in figures and writing, Ben in faces and mischief. His master says
               of him, that, if there were two such in the school, he must resign his<pb n=”261”/>
               office; and, as far as my observation goes, the worthy pedagogue is right. Ben is, it
               must be confessed, a great corrupter of gravity. He hath an exceeding aver- sion to
               authority and decorum, and a wonderful bold- ness and dexterity in overthrowing the
               one and puzzling the other. His contortions of visage are astounding. His “power over
               his own muscles and those of other people” is almost equal to that of Liston; and
               indeed the original face, flat and square and Chinese in its shape, of a fine tan
               complexion, with a snub nose, and a slit for a mouth, is nearly as comical as that
               matchless performer’s. When aided by Ben’s singular mobility of feature, his knowing
               winks and grins and shrugs and nods, together with a certain dry shrewdness, a habit
               of saying sharp things, and a marvellous gift of impu- dence, it forms as fine a
               specimen as possible of a hu- morous country boy, an oddity in embryo. Every body
               likes Ben, except his butts; (which may perhaps comprise half his acquaintance;) and
               of them no one so thoroughly hates and dreads him as our parish school- master, a
               most worthy King Log, whom Ben dumb- founds twenty times a day. He is a great
               ornament of the cricket-ground, has a real genius for the game, and displaystit after
               a very original manner, under the dis- guise of awkwardness—as the clown shows off
               his agility in a pantomime. Nothing comes amiss to him. By the bye, he would have
               been the very lad for us in<pb n=”262”/> our present dilemma; not a horse in England
               could master Ben Kirby. But we are too far from him now—and perhaps it is as well
               that we are so. I believe the rogue has a kindness for me, in remembrance of certain
               apples and nuts, which my usual companion, who delights in his wit, is accustomed to
               dole out to him. But it is a Robin Goodfellow nevertheless, a perfect Puck, that
               loves nothing on earth so well as mischief. Perhaps the horse may be the safer con-
               ductor of the two.</p>
            <p>The avenue is quite alive to-day. Old women are picking up twigs and acorns, and pigs
               of all sizes doing their utmost to spare them the latter part of the trou- ble; boys
               and girls groping for beech-nuts under yonder clump; and a group of younger elves
               collect- ing as many dead leaves as they can find to feed the bonfire which is
               smoking away so briskly amongst the trees,—a sort of rehearsal of the grand bonfire
               nine days hence; of the loyal conflagration of the arch traitor Guy Vaux, which is
               annually solemnized in the avenue, accompanied with as much of squibbery and crackery
               as our boys can beg or borrow—not to say steal. Ben Kirby is a great man on the 5th
               of Novem- ber. All the savings of a month, the hoarded half- pence, the new
               farthings, the very luck-penny, go off infumo on that night. For my part, I like this
               day- light mockery better. There is no gunpowder—odious<pb n=”263”/> gunpowder! no
               noise but the merry shouts of the small fry, so shrill and happy, and the cawing of
               the rooks, who are wheeling in large circles overhead, and wondering what is going
               forward in their territory— seeming in their loud clamour to ask what that light
               smoke may mean that curls so prettily amongst their old oaks, towering as if to meet
               the clouds. There is something very intelligent in the ways of that black people the
               rooks, particularly in their wonder. I sup- pose it results from their numbers and
               their unity of purpose, a sort of collective and corporate wisdom. Yet geese
               congregate also; and geese never by any chance look wise. But then geese are a
               domestic fowl; we have spoiled them; and rooks are free com- moners of nature, who
               use the habitations we provide for them, tenant our groves and our avenues, and never
               dream of becoming our subjects.</p>
            <p>What a labyrinth of a road this is! I do think there are four turnings in the short
               half-mile between the avenue and the mill. And what a pity, as my companion
               observes—not that our good and jolly mil- ler, the very representative of the old
               English yeo- manry, should be so rich, but that one consequence of his riches should
               be the pulling-down of the prettiest old mill that ever looked at itself in the
               Loddon, with the picturesque low-browed irregular cottage, which stood with its
               light-pointed roof, its clustered chim-<pb n=”264”/> neys, and its ever-open door,
               looking like the real abode of comfort and hospitality, to build this huge, staring,
               frightful, red-brick mill, as ugly as a manu- factory, and this great square house,
               ugly and red to match, just behind. The old buildings always used to remind me of
               Wollett’s beautiful engraving of a scene in the Maid of the Mill. It will be long
               before any artist will make a drawing of this. Only think of this redness in a
               picture! this boiled lobster of a house! Falstaff’s description of Bardolph’s nose
               would look pale in the comparison.</p>
            <p>Here is that monstrous machine of a tilted waggon, with its load of flour, and its
               four fat horses. I won- der whether our horse will have the decency to get out of the
               way. If he does not, I am sure we cannot make him; and that enormous ship upon
               wheels, that ark on dry land, would roll over us like the car of Jaggernaut.
               Really—Oh no! there is no danger now. I should have remembered that it is my friend
               Samuel Long who drives the mill-team. He will take care of us. “Thank you, Samuel!”
               And Samuel has put us on our way, steered us safely past his waggon, escorted us over
               the bridge; and now, having seen us through our immediate difficulties, has parted
               from us with a very civil bow and good-humoured smile, as one who is always civil and
               good-humoured, but with a certain triumphant masterful look in his eyes, which I
                  have<pb n=”265”/> noted in men, even the best of them, when a woman gets into
               straits by attempting manly employments. He has done us great good though, and may be
               al- lowed his little feeling of superiority. The parting salute he bestowed on our
               steed, in the shape of an astounding crack of his huge whip, has put that re-
               fractory animal on his mettle. On we go fast! past the glazier’s pretty house, with
               its porch and its filberd walk; along the narrow lane bordered with elms, whose
               fallen leaves have made the road one yellow; past that little farm-house with the
               horse-chesnut trees before, glowing like oranges; past the whitewashed school on the
               other side, gay with October roses; past the park, and the lodge, and the mansion,
               where once dwelt the great earl of Clarendon;—and now the rascal has begun to
               discover that Samuel Long and his whip are a mile off, and that his mistress is
               driving him, and he slackens his pace accordingly. Perhaps he feels the beauty of the
               road just here, and goes slowly to enjoy it. Very beautiful it certainly is. The park
               paling forms the boundary on one side, with fine clumps of oak, and deer in all
               attitudes3 the water, tufted with alders, flowing along on the other. Another turn,
               and the water winds away, succeeded by a low hedge, and a sweep of green meadows;
               whilst the park and its paling are replaced by a steep bank, on which stands a small,
               quiet, village ale-house; and<pb n=”266”/> higher up, embosomed in wood, is the
               little country church, with its sloping church-yard and its low white steeple,
               peeping out from amongst magnificent yew- trees:</p>
            <note place=”inline”>“Huge trunks! and each particular trunk a growth Of intertwisted
               fibres serpentine Up-coiling, and jnvet’rately convolved.” Wordsworth.</note>
            <p>No village-church was ever more happily placed. It is the very image of the peace and
               humbleness incul- cated within its walls.</p>
            <p>Ah! here is a higher hill rising before us, almost like a mountain. How grandly the
               view opens as we ascend over that wild bank, overgrown with fern, and heath, and
               gorse, and between those tall hollies, glow- ing with their coral berries! What an
               expanse! But we have little time to gaze at present; for that piece of perversity,
               our horse, who has walked over so much level ground, has now, inspired, I presume, by
               a desire to revisit his stable, taken it into that unaccountable noddle of his to
               trot up this, the very steepest hill in the county. Here we are on the top; and in
               five minutes we have reached the lawn gate, and are in the very midst of that
               beautiful piece of art or nature (I do not know to which class it belongs), the
               pleasure- ground of F. Hill. Never was the”prophetic eye of<pb n=”267”/> taste”
               exerted with more magical skill than in these plantations. Thirty years ago this
               place had no exist- ence; it was a mere undistinguished tract of field and meadow and
               common land; now it is a mimic forest, delighting the eye with the finest
               combinations of trees and shrubs, the rarest effects of form and foliage, and
               bewildering the mind with its green glades, and impervious recesses, and apparently
               interminable ex- tent. It is the triumph of landscape gardening, and never more
               beautiful than in this autumn sunset, light- ing up the ruddy beech and the spotted
               sycamore, and gilding the shining fir-cones that hang so thickly amongst the dark
               pines. The robins are singing around us, as if they too felt the magic of the hour.
               How gracefully the road winds through the leafy labyrinth, leading imperceptibly to
               the more orna- mented sweep. Here we are at the door amidst gera- niums, and
               carnations, and jasmines, still in flower. Ah! here is a flower sweeter than all, a
               bird gayer than the robin, the little bird that chirps to the tune of “mamma! mamma!”
               the bright-faced fairy, whose tiny feet come pattering along, making a merry music,
               mamma’s own Frances! And following her guidance, here we are in the dear round room
               time enough to catch the last rays of the sun, as they light the noble landscape
               which lies like a panorama around us, lin-<pb n=”268”/> gering longest on that long
               island of old thorns and stunted oaks, the oasis of B. Heath, and then vanish- ing in
               a succession of gorgeous clouds.</p>
            <p>October 28.—Another soft and brilliant morning. But the pleasures of to-day must be
               written in short- hand. I have left myself no room for notes of admi- ration.</p>
            <p>First we drove about the coppice; an extensive wood of oak, and elm, and beech,
               chiefly the former, which adjoins the park paling of F. Hill, of which de- mesne,
               indeed, it forms one of the most delightful parts. The roads through the coppice are
               studiously wild, so that they have the appearance of mere cart- tracts: and the
               manner in which the ground is tum- bled about, the steep declivities, the sunny
               slopes, the sudden swells and falls, now a close narrow valley, then a sharp ascent
               to an eminence, commanding an immense extent of prospect, have a striking air of
               natural beauty, developed and heightened by the perfection of art. All this, indeed,
               was familiar to me; the colour- ing only was new. I had been there in early spring,
               when the fragrant palms were on the willow, and the yellow tassels on the hazel, and
               every twig was swell- ing with renewed life; and I had been there again and again in
               the green leanness of midsummer; but never as now, when the dark verdure of the
                  fir-plantations,<pb n=”269”/> hanging over the picturesque and unequal paling,
               partly covered with moss and ivy, contrasts so remark- ably with the shining
               orange-leaves of the beech, already half fallen, the pale yellow of the scattering
               elm, the deeper and richer tints of the oak, and the glossy stems of the “lady of the
               woods,” the delicate weeping birch. The underwood is no less picturesque. The
               red-spotted leaves, and redder berries of the old thorns, the scarlet festoons of the
               bramble, the tall fern of every hue, seem to vie with the brilliant mo- saic of the
               ground, now covered with dead leaves, and strewn with fircones, now, where a little
               glade inter- venes, gay with various mosses and splendid fungi. How beautiful is this
               coppice to-day! especially where the little spring, as clear as crystal, comes
               bubbling out from the “old fantastic” beech root, and trickles over the grass, bright
               and silent as the dew in a May morning. The wood pigeons (who are just returned from
               their summer migration, and are cropping the ivy berries) add their low cooings, the
               very note of love, to the slight fluttering of the fallen leaves in the quiet air,
               giving a voice to the sunshine and the beauty. This coppice is a place to live and
               die in. But we must go. And how fine is the ascent which leads us again into the
               world, past those cottages hidden as in a pit, and by that hanging orchard and that
                  rough<pb n=”270”/> heathy bank! The scenery in this one spot has a wild- ness, an
               abruptness of rise and fall, rare in any part of England, rare above all in this rich
               and lovely but monotonous county. It is Switzerland in minia- ture.</p>
            <p>And now we cross the hill to pay a morning visit to the family at the great
               house,—another fine place, commanding another fine sweep of country. The park,
               studded with old trees, and sinking gently into a valley, rich in wood and water, is
               in the best style of ornamental landscape, though more according to the common
               routine of gentlemen’s seats than the singularly original place which we have just
               left. There is, how- ever, one distinctive beauty in the grounds of the great
               house;—the magnificent firs which shade the terraces and surround the sweep, giving
               out in summer odours really Sabaean, and now in this low autumn sun pro- ducing an
               effect almost magical, as the huge red trunks, garlanded with ivy, stand out from the
               deep shadows like an army of giants. In-doors—Oh I must not take my readers in-doors,
               or we shall never getaway! —In-doors the sunshine is brighter still; for there, in a
               lofty lightsome room, sits a damsel fair and arch and piquante, one whom Titian or
               Velasquez should be born again to paint, leaning over an instrument * as<note
                  place=”bottom”>* The dital harp.</note><pb n=”271”/> sparkling and fanciful as
               herself, singing pretty French romances, and Scottish Jacobite songs, and all sorts
               of graceful and airy drolleries picked up I know not where—an English
               improvvisatrice! a gayer Annot Lyle! whilst her sister, of a higher order of beauty,
               and with an earnest kindness in her smile that deepens its power, lends to the piano,
               as her father to the violin, an expression, a sensibility, a spirit, an elo- quence,
               almost super-human—almost divine! Oh to hear these two instruments accompanying my
               dear com- panion (I forgot to say that she is a singer worthy to be so accompanied)
               in Haydn’s exquisite canzonet, “She never told her love,”—to hear her voice, with all
               its power, its sweetness, its gush of sound, so sus- tained and assisted by
               modulations that rivalled its in- tensity of expression; to hear at once such poetry,
               such music, such execution, is a pleasure never to be forgotten, or mixed with meaner
               things. I seem to hear it still.</p>
            <note place=”bottom”>As in the bursting spring time o’er the eye Of one who haunts the
               fields fair visions creep Beneath the closed lids (afore dull sleep Dims the quick
               fancy) of sweet flowers that lie On grassy banks, oxlip of orient dye, And palest
               primrose and blue violet, All in their fresh and dewy beauty set, Pictur’d within the
               sense, and will not fly:</note>
            <pb n=”272”/>
            <note place=”top”>So in mine ear resounds and lives again One mingled melody,—a voice, a
               pair Of instruments most voice-like! Of the air Rather than of the earth seems that
               high strain, A spirit’s song, and worthy of the train That sooth’d old Prospero with
               music rare.</note>
