            <p>The finest young man in our village is undoubtedly Joel Brent, half-brother to my
               Lizzy. They are alike too; as much alike as a grown-up person and a little child of
               different sexes well can be; alike in a vigorous uprightness of form, light, firm,
               and compact as possible; alike in the bright, sparkling, triumphant blue eye, the
               short-curled upper lip, the brown wavy hair, the white forehead and sunburnt cheeks,
               and, above all, in the singular spirit and gaiety of their countenance and demeanour,
               the constant ex- pression of life and glee, to which they owe the best and rarest
               part of their attractiveness. They seem, and they are two of the happiest and
               merriest creatures that ever trod on the greensward. Really to see Joel walking by
               the side of his team, (for this enviable mortal, the pride of our village, is by
               calling a carter), to see him walking, on a fine sunny morning, by the side of his
               bell-team, the fore-horse decked with rib- bons and flowers like a countess on the
               birth-day, as<pb n=”189”/> consciously handsome as his driver, the long whip poised
               gracefully on his shoulder, his little sister in his hand, and his dog Ranger (a
               beautiful red and white spaniel—every thing that belongs to Joel is beautiful)
               frisking about them:—to see this group, and to hear the merry clatter formed by
               Lizzy’s tongue, Joel’s whistling, and Ranger’s delighted bark, is enough to put an
               amateur of pleasant sounds and happy faces in good humour for the day.</p>
            <p>It is a grateful sight in other respects, for Joel is a very picturesque person, just
               such an one as a painter would select for the fore-ground of some English landscape,
               where nature is shewn in all her loveliness. His costume is the very perfection of
               rustic coquetry, of that grace, which all admire and few practise, the grace of
               adaptation, the beauty of fitness. No one ever saw Joel in that wretched piece of
               deformity a coat, or that still wretcheder apology for a coat a dock- tailed jacket.
               Broad-cloth, the “common stale” of peer and peasant, approaches him not; neither does
               “the poor creature,” fustian. His upper garment con- sists of that prettier jacket
               without skirts, call it for the more grace a doublet, of dark velveteen, hanging open
               over his waistcoat, giving a Spanish or an Italian air to his whole appearance, and
               setting off to great advantage his trim yet manly shape. To this he adds a silk
               handkerchief, tied very loosely round his neck,<pb n=”190”/> a shirt collar open so
               as to shew his throat, as you commonly see in the portraits of artists, very loose
               trowsers, and a straw hat. Sometimes in cold wea- ther he throws over all a
               smock-frock, and last winter brought up a fashion amongst our lads, by assuming one
               of that blue bight Waterloo, such as butchers wear. As soon as all his comrades had
               provided themselves with a similar piece of rustic finery, he abandoned his, and
               indeed generally sticks to his vel- veteen jacket, which, by some magical influence
               of cleanliness and neatness, always looks new. I cannot imagine how he contrives it,
               but dirt never hangs upon Joel; even a fall at cricket in the summer, or a tumble on
               the ice in the winter, fails to soil him; and he is so ardent in his diversions, and
               so little disposed to let his coxcombry interfere with his sports, that both have
               been pretty often tried; the former especially.</p>
            <p>Ever since William Grey’s secession, which took place shortly after our great match,
               for no cause as- signed, Joel has been the leader and chief of our cricketers.
               Perhaps, indeed, Joel’s rapid improve- ment might be one cause of William’s
               withdrawal, for, without attributing any thing like envy or jealousy to these fine
               young men, we all know that “two stars keep not their motion in one sphere,” and so
               forth, and if it were absolutely necessary that either our “Harry Hotspur, or the
               Prince of Wales,” should abdi-<pb n=”191”/> cate that fair kingdom the
               cricket-ground, I must say that I am content to retain our present champion. Joel is
               in my mind the better player, joining to Wil- liam’s agility, and certainty of hand
               and eye, all the ardour, force, and gaiety of his own quick and lively spirit. The
               whole man is in the game, mind and body; and his success is such as dexterity and
               enthu- siasm united must always command. To be sure he is a leetle over eager, that I
               must confess, and does occasionally run out a slow mate; but he is sure to make up
               for it by his own exertions, and after all what a delightful fault zeal is! Now that
               we are on the subject of faults, it must be said, not that Joel has his share, which
               is of course, but that they are exceed- ingly venial, little shades that become him,
               and arise out of his brighter qualities as smoke from the flame. Thus, if he
               sometimes steals one of his active holidays for a revel or a cricket-match, he is
               sure to make up the loss to his master by a double portion of labour the next day;
               and if now and then at tide-times, he loiters in the chimney-corner of the Rose,
               rather longer than strict prudence might warrant, no one can hear his laugh and his
               song pouring through the open door, like the very voice of “jest and youthful jol-
               lity,” without feeling certain that it is good fellowship, and not good liquor, that
               detains him. Indeed so much is he the delight of the country lads, who fre-<pb
                  n=”192”/> quent that well-accustomed inn, so much is his company sought after in
               all rustic junketings, that I am only astonished at the strength of resolution, and
               power of resisting temptation, which he displays in going thither so seldom.</p>
            <p>If our village lads be so fond of him, it is not to be doubted that our village
               maidens like him too. The pretty brunette, Sally Wheeler, who left a good ser- vice
               at B., to take in needle-work, and come home to her grandmother, she being, to use
               Sally’s phrase, “unkedfor want of company,” (N. B. Dame Wheeler is as deaf as a post,
               a cannon would not rouse her), is thought, in our little world, to have had an eye to
               Joel in this excess of dutifulness. Miss Phoebe, the lass of the Rose, she also,
               before her late splendid marriage to the patten-maker, is said to have becurled and
               beflounced herself at least two tiers higher on club-nights, and Sundays, and
               holidays, and whenever there was a probable chance of meeting him. The gay recruiting
               serjeant, and all other beaux were abandoned the instant he appeared; nay, it is even
               hinted, that the patten-maker owes his fair bride partly to pique at Joel’s
               indifference. Then Miss Sophia Matthews, the schoolmistress on the lea, to whom in
               point of dignity Miss Phoebe was nothing, who wears a muff and a veil, walks
               mincingly, and tosses her head in the air, keeps a maid,—a poor little drab<pb
                  n=”193”/> of ten years old; follows, as she says, a genteel pro- fession,—I think
               she may have twenty scholars at eight-pence a week; and when she goes to dine with
               her brother, the collar-maker, hires a boy for a penny to carry her clogs;—Miss
               Sophia, it is well known, hath pretermitted her dignity in the matter of Joel; hath
               invited the whole family to tea (only think of Joel at a tea-party ?) hath spoken of
               him as “a person above the common: a respectable young man; one, who with a discreet
               and accomplished wife, a woman of reading and education,” (Miss Sophia, in the days
               of her father, the late collar-maker of happy memory, before she “taught the young
               idea how to shoot,” had herself drunk deeply at that well of knowledge, the
               circulating library of B.) “not too young,” (Miss Sophia calls herself twenty-eight—I
               wonder what the register says!) “no brazen-faced gipsy, like Sally Wheeler,” (Miss
               Sophia’s cast of countenance is altogether different from Sally’s dark and sparkling
               beauty, she being pink-eyed, red-haired, lean, pale, and freckled) “or the jill-flirt
               Phoebe” but to cut short an oration which in spite of the lady’s gentility, began to
               grow rather scurrilous, one fact was certain, .—that Joel might, had he so chosen,
               have worn the crown matrimonial in Miss Sophia’s territories, con- sisting of a
               freehold-cottage, a little the worse for wear, a good garden, a capital orchard, and
               an exten-<pb n=”194”/> sive right of common; to say nothing of the fair dam- sel and
               her school, or, as she is accustomed to call it, her seminary.</p>
            <p>Joel’s proud bright eye glanced, however, carelessly over all. There was little
               perceptible difference of feeling in the gay distant smile, with which he re- garded
               the coquettish advances of the pretty brunette, Sally Wheeler, or the respectful bow
               with which he retreated from the dignified condescension of Miss Sophia. He fluttered
               about our village belles like a butterfly over a bed of tulips; sometimes approaching
               them for a moment, and seeing them ready to fix, but oftener above and out of reach,
               a creature of a spright- lier element, too buoyant and volatile to light on an
               earthly flower. At last, however, the rover was caught; and our damsel, Harriet, had
               the glory of win- ning that indomitable heart.</p>
            <p>Now Harriet is in all things Lucy’s successor; in post, and favour, and beauty, and
               lovers. In my eye she is still prettier than Lucy; there is something so feminine and
               so attractive in her loveliness. She is a tall young woman, finely, though, for
               eighteen, rather fully formed; with a sweet child-like face, a fair blooming
               complexion, a soft innocent smile, and the eye of a dove. Add to this a gentle voice,
               a quiet modest manner, and a natural gentility of appearance, and no wonder that
               Harriet might vie with her pre-<pb n=”195”/> decessor in the number of her admirers.
               She in- herited also a spice of her coquetry, although it was shewn in so different a
               way that we did not imme- diately find it out. Lucy was a flirt active; Harriet was a
               flirt passive: Lucy talked to her beaux; Harriet only listened to her’s; Lucy, when
               challenged on the number of her conquests, denied the thing, and blushed, and
               laughed, and liked to be laughed at; Harriet, on a similar charge, gave no token of
               liking or denial, but said quietly that she could not help it, and went on winning
               hearts by dozens, prodigal of smiles but chary of love, till Joel came, “pleased her
               by manners most unlike her own,” and gave to her de- licate womanly beauty the only
               charms it wanted—sen- sibility and consciousness.</p>
            <p>The manner in which we discovered this new flirta- tion, which, unlike her others,
               was concealed with the pretty reserve and mystery that wait on true love, was
               sufficiently curious. We had noted Joel more frequently than common about the house:
               sometimes he came for Lizzy; sometimes to bring news of a cricket-match; sometimes to
               ask questions about bats and balls; sometimes to see if his dog Ranger had followed
               my May; sometimes to bring me a nosegay. All this occasioned no suspicion; we were
               too glad to see Joel to think of enquiring why he came. But when the days shortened,
               and evening closed in dark<pb n=”196”/> and cold before his work was done, and
               cricket and flowers were over, and May and Lizzy safe in their own warm beds, and
               poor Joel’s excuses fairly at an end; then it was, that in the after-dinner pause
               about seven, when the clatter of plates and dishes was over, that the ornithological
               ear of the master of the house, a dabbler in natural history, was struck by a regular
               and melodious call, the note, as he averred, of a sky-lark. That a sky-lark should
               sing in front of our house, at seven o’clock, in a December evening, seemed, to say
               the least, rather startling. But our ornithologist happening to agree with Mr. White,
               of Selborne, in the opinion, that many more birds sing by night than is commonly
               supposed, and becoming more and more confident of the identity of the note, thought
               the thing possible; and not being able to dis- cover any previous notice of the fact,
               had nearly in- serted it, as an original observation, in the Naturalist’s Calendar,
               when running out suddenly one moonlight night, to try for a peep at the nocturnal
               songster, he caught our friend Joel, whose accomplishments in this line we had never
               dreamt of, in the act of whistling a summons to his lady love.</p>
            <p>For some weeks our demure coquette listened to none but this bird-like wooing; partly
               from pride in the conquest; partly from real preference; and partly, I believe, from
               a lurking consciousness that Joel was<pb n=”197”/> by no means a lover to be trifled
               with. Indeed he used to threaten, between jest and earnest, a ducking in the
               goose-pond opposite, to whoever should presume to approach his fair intended; and the
               waters being high and muddy, and he at all points a formidable rival, most of her
               former admirers were content to stay away. At last, however, she relapsed into her
               old sin of listening. A neighbouring farmer gave a ball in his barn, to which both
               our lovers were invited and went. Now Harriet loves dancing, and Joel,though arrayed
               in a new jacket, and thin cricketing-pumps, would not dance; he said he could not,
               but that, as Harriet observes, is incredible. I agree with her that the gentleman was
               too fine. He chose to stand and look on, and laugh, and make laugh, the whole even-
               ing. In the meantime his fair betrothed picked up a new partner, and a new beau, in
               the shape of a freshly- arrived carpenter, a grand martial-looking figure, as tall as
               a grenadier, who was recently engaged as foreman to our civil wheeler, and who, even
               if he had heard of the denunciation, was of a size and spirit to set Joel and the
               goose-pond at defiance,—David might as well have attempted to goose-pond Goliath! He
               danced the whole evening with his pretty partner, and after- wards saw her home; all
               of which Joel bore with great philosophy. But the next night he came again; and Joel
               approaching to give his own sky-lark signal,<pb n=”198”/> was startled at seeing
               another lover leaning over the wicket, and his faithless mistress standing at the
               half-open door, listening to the tall carpenter, just as complacently as she was wont
               to do to himself. He passed on without speaking, turned down the little lane that
               leads to Dame Wheeler’s cottage, and in less than two minutes Harriet heard the
               love-call sounded at Sally’s gate. The effect was instantaneous; she discarded the
               tall carpenter at once and for ever, locked and bolted the door, and sat down to work
               or to cry in the kitchen. She did not cry long. The next night we again heard the
               note of the sky-lark louder and more brilliant than ever, echoing across our court,
               and the lovers, the better friends for their little quarrel, have been as constant as
               turtle-doves ever since</p>
