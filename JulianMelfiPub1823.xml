         <p>TEI P5 conformant: We are coding this to compare the manuscript of the play submitted
				to the Lord Chamberlain's office with the published version, using the witness
				encoding apparatus provided by the TEI. Page breaks recorded here are in the
				manuscript version. We have not indicated the change in abbreviation of character
				names from manuscript to print, since these seem insignificant, but rather have
				concentrated on recording variations in punctuation, word choice, and lineation of
				speeches.</p>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>In representing Mitford's manuscript, Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next. Where Mitford’s spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

            <p>The Story and Characters of the following Tragedy, are
							altogether fictitious. Annabel's cautions to silence in the first Scene,
							and the short dialogue between her and Julian, after he awakens, will be
							recognised by the classical reader as borrowed from the fine opening of
							the Orestes of Euripedes; the incident of uncovering the body in the
							last Act, is also taken from the Electra of Sophocles. Of any other
							intentional imitation, the Author is unconscious.</p>
            <p>She has now the pleasant task of conveying her
							acknowledgments to the whole of the Performers, for the zealous
							co-operation which has so much contributed to the success of the Play.
							To the talents of Miss Foote, Miss Lacy, Mr. Abbott, and Mr. Bennett,
							she is more especially indebted--and to Mr. Macready beyond all. That it
							has been honoured by the particular approbation of such a judge, and has
							given occasion to one of the most splendid exertions of such an Actor,
