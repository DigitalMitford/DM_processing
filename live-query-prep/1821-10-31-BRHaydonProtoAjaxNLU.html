                  <span class="prose">The magnificent portion of bride cake arrived this morning &amp; shall be distributed
               as you desire. Yes, we will set half the pretty girls in the parish dreaming on it--I
               wanted to make a bargain with one to whom I gave a bit just now that she should tell me her dream--but she says that would destroy the charm--If she told who the husband was to be she should never <span class="del"> </span> get him. There was no saying a word after that you know. Bythebye nothing but the sort of sacred air that breathes around Bridecake--so that to steal that would be to invade the sweetest &amp;
                     holiest of our affections &amp; sympathies--nothing but this fine &amp; general
                     feeling could have preserved your munificent present,  &amp; brought it safe to us. By some accident it was sent not by a <span class="context" title="place">Reading<span class="si" title="Reading_city"/>
                     </span> Coach but a <span class="context" title="place">Newbury<span class="si" title="Newbury"/>
                     </span> one, &amp; found its way to <span class="context" title="place">Three Mile
                  Cross<span class="si" title="ThreeMileCross"/>
                     </span>, after being carried half way to <span class="context" title="place">Newbury<span class="si" title="Newbury"/>
                     </span>, through the intervention of all manner of men &amp;
               women--Post boys--&amp; Chambermaids &amp; keepers of Turnpike gates. But every thing
               belonging to such a <span class="context" title="rs">Wedding<span class="si" title="HaydonHymanWed"/>
                     </span> &amp; such a
               Honeymoon as yours will turn out right depend on it. You see that your good luck extends even to your friends--&amp;
               travels about with your bride-cake. Oh it will never forsake you! Never! I think that last honeymoon letter written whilst the fair Bride was sitting working &amp; smiling at your side, was prettier even than the first. Did you read it
               to her as you wrote it? or <span class="pagebreak">page 2<br/>
                     </span> shall I send her a copy? It was worthy even of
               that charming seal. How much you must both have felt in going into your painting room!-- Will <span class="context" title="title">the Lazarus<span class="si" title="Lazarus_Haydon"/>
                     </span> be finished against next
               season? If any thing could improve your genius it would be living in such a sunshine of love &amp; beauty.</span>

                     </span>--She mentioned your note with great

                     would return to <span class="context" title="place">Lisson

                     </span> which I have should of all things have wished  you to read--indeed I begged her to take the chance--I have such an opinion of your judgment. But it is now out of her hands. Only
               think of my shocking ill luck in having written on the same subject with <span class="context" title="person">Lord Byron<span class="si" title="Byron"/>

                  not merely with his Lordship's talents, but with his great name, &amp; the strange

                     1821</span>. Byron had composed it between <span class="date" title="1821-06-12-1821-07-09">12 June and 9 July 1821</span> in <span class="context" title="place">Ravenna<span class="si" title="Ravenna"/>

               I rather think now that it will not be offered--that <span class="context" title="person">Mr. Talfourd<span class="si" title="Talfourd_Thos"/>
                     </span> will suppress it--&amp; I heartily wish he may. My poor

                     </span> has been a work of great labour &amp; is certainly complete enough in
                     its own small way, but it is abundantly womanish &amp; feeble, &amp; does not
                     at all adhere to the literal historic truth--which would be a great
                     disadvantage in case <span class="context" title="rs">the noble author<span class="si" title="Byron"/>
                     </span>
                     <span class="pagebreak">page 3<br/>
                     </span> should have done so, &amp;
                     have made the public familiar with the facts. I hope it will not be offered.
                     What do you think of <span class="context" title="person">Lord Byron's<span class="si" title="Byron"/>
                     </span> dramatic
                     power? <span class="context" title="title">Manfred<span class="si" title="Manfred"/>
                     </span> was very fine certainly--perhaps
                     the finest thing he ever did--&amp; <span class="context" title="title">Marino

                     </span> certainly the worst. But <span class="context" title="person">Foscari<span class="si" title="Foscari_Fr"/>
                     </span> is a story of real human sympathy--not of factitious
                     sentiment--He will certainly succeed in that. If this play
                     be sent back to me unoffered I shall immediately begin another  on some German story&amp; shall take for the opening the exquisite first act of the <span class="context" title="title">Orestes<span class="si" title="Orestes_play"/>

                     quite wonderful to think has never been transferred to the English stage. What astonishing people those Greek dramatists were! I am just now reading
